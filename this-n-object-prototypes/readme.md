# Foreword

# Chapter 1: this Or That?
## Why `this`?
```js
function identify() {
	return this.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak() {
	var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify.call( this );
	console.log( greeting );
}

var me = {
	name: "Kyle"
};

var you = {
	name: "Reader"
};

identify.call( me ); // KYLE
identify.call( you ); // READER

speak.call( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
speak.call( you ); // Hello, I'm READER
```

* This code snippet allows the `identify()` and `speak()` functions to be re-used against `multiple` `context` (`me` and `you`) `objects`, `rather than` needing a `separate version of the function` `for each object`.

* Instead of [...] `this`, you could have `explicitly passed` in a `context object` to both `identify()` and `speak()`.

```js
function identify(context) {
	return context.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak(context) {
	var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify( context );
	console.log( greeting );
}

identify( you ); // READER
speak( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
```

* However, the `this` mechanism provides a more `elegant` way of `implicitly "passing along"` an object reference, leading to `cleaner API design`.

## Confusions
### Itself
* The first common temptation is to assume `this` refers to the function itself.

* to illustrate how `this` doesn't let a function get a reference to itself [...] Consider the following code.

```js
function foo(num) {
	console.log( "foo: " + num );

	// keep track of how many times `foo` is called
	this.count++;
}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
	if (i > 5) {
		foo( i );
	}
}
// foo: 6
// foo: 7
// foo: 8
// foo: 9

// how many times was `foo` called?
console.log( foo.count ); // 0 -- WTF?
```

* When the code executes `foo.count = 0`, indeed it's adding a property `count` to the function object `foo`. But [...] `this` is not [...]pointing [...] to that function object.

* In fact [...] a `global variable` `count` (me: is accidentally created) (see Chapter 2 for *how* that happened!), and it currently has the value `NaN`.

* To reference a function object `from inside itself` [...] You [...] need a reference to the function object via a `lexical identifier` (variable) that points at it.

```js
function foo() {
	foo.count = 4; // `foo` refers to itself
}

setTimeout( function(){
	// anonymous function (no name), cannot
	// refer to itself
}, 10 );
```

* `now deprecated` [...] `arguments.callee` reference inside a function `also` points to the function object of the `currently executing function`. This [...] is [...] the only way to access an `anonymous function's object` `from inside itself`.

* another solution to our running example.

```js
function foo(num) {
	console.log( "foo: " + num );

	// keep track of how many times `foo` is called
	foo.count++;
}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
	if (i > 5) {
		foo( i );
	}
}
// foo: 6
// foo: 7
// foo: 8
// foo: 9

// how many times was `foo` called?
console.log( foo.count ); // 4
```

### Its Scope
* next most common misconception about [...] `this` is that it [...] refers to the `function's scope`.

* internally, scope is kind of like an object with properties for each of the available `identifiers`. But the `scope "object"` is `not accessible` to `JavaScript code`.

## What's `this`?
* When a function is invoked, an `activation record`, otherwise known as an `execution context`, is created. This record contains information about [...] the `call-stack` [...] `how` the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the `properties` `of this record` is the `this` reference `which` will be used for the `duration of that function's execution`.

## Review (TL;DR)

# Chapter 2: `this` All Makes Sense Now!
## Call-site
* `call-site`: the `location` `in code` where a function is `called` (`not` where it's `declared`). We must `inspect` the `call-site` to answer the question: what's `this` a reference to?

* locate where a function is called from [...] not always that easy, as certain coding patterns can obscure the `true` `call-site`.

* the `call-stack` (the `stack of functions` that have been called to `get us to` the `current moment in execution`). The `call-site` [...] is in the `invocation` `before` `the currently executing function`.

```js
function baz() {
    // call-stack is: `baz`
    // so, our call-site is in the global scope

    console.log( "baz" );
    bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
}

function bar() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
    // so, our call-site is in `baz`

    console.log( "bar" );
    foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
}

function foo() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
    // so, our call-site is in `bar`

    console.log( "foo" );
}

baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
```

* Take care when [...] find the actual `call-site` (`from` the `call-stack`), because it's the only thing that matters for `this` binding.

* Another way of seeing the `call-stack` is using a `debugger` tool in your browser [...] you could have set a `breakpoint` in the `tools` for the first line of the `foo()` function, or [...] inserted the `debugger;` statement on that first line. When you run the page, the `debugger` will `pause at this location`, and will show you a `call stack`.

* So, if you're trying to diagnose `this` binding, use the `developer tools` to get the `call-stack`, then find the `second item from the top`, and that will show you the real `call-site`.

## Nothing But Rules
* You must inspect the `call-site` and determine which of `4 rules` applies. We will first explain each of these `4 rules` independently, and then we will illustrate their `order of precedence`, `if` `multiple rules` could apply to the `call-site`.

### Default Binding
The `first rule` [...] Think of this `this` rule as the default `catch-all rule` when `none of the other rules apply`.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2
```

* variables declared in the `global scope`, as `var a = 2` is, are synonymous with `global-object properties` of the same name.

* when `foo()` is called, `this.a` `resolves` to our global variable `a` [...] Because in this case, the `default binding` for `this` [...] points `this` at the `global object`.

* How do we know that the `default binding` rule applies here? We examine the `call-site` to see how `foo()` is called. In our snippet, `foo()` is called with a plain, `un-decorated function reference`. `None of the other rules` [...] will apply here, so the `default binding` applies instead.

* If `strict mode` is in effect, the `global object` is `not eligible` for the `default binding`, so the `this` is instead set to `undefined`.

```js
function foo() {
	"use strict";

	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`
```

* (me: beware of mixing `use strict` and `non-strict mode`).

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

(function(){
	"use strict";

	foo(); // 2
})();
```

* mixing `strict mode` and `non-strict mode` [...] is [...] `frowned upon`. Your entire program should [...] either be **Strict** or `non-Strict`. `However`, sometimes you include a `third-party library` that has `different` `Strict`'ness than your own code, so care must be taken over these subtle compatibility details.

### Implicit Binding
* `Another rule` [...] is: does the `call-site` have a `context object`, [...] an `owning` or `containing` `object`, though `these` alternate terms could be slightly misleading.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

obj.foo(); // 2
```

* notice [...] `foo()` is declared and then later added as a `reference property` onto `obj`. `Regardless of` whether `foo()` is `initially declared` `on` `obj`, or is `added as a reference later` [...] in `neither` case is the `function` `really` "`owned`" or "`contained`" by the `obj` object.

* `However`, the `call-site` `uses` the `obj` context to `reference` the function, so you `could` say that the `obj` object "`owns`" or "`contains`" the `function reference` `at the time` `the function is called`.

* `at the point` that `foo()` `is called`, it's `preceded` by an `object reference` to `obj`. `When` there is a `context object` for a function reference, the `implicit binding` rule says that it's `that` `object` which should be used for the `function call's` `this` binding.

* `Only` the [...] `last` level of an `object property reference chain` matters to the `call-site`.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj2 = {
	a: 42,
	foo: foo
};

var obj1 = {
	a: 2,
	obj2: obj2
};

obj1.obj2.foo(); // 42
```

#### Implicitly Lost
One of the most common frustrations [...] (me: with) `this` binding [...] is when an `implicitly bound function` `loses that binding`, which usually means it falls back to the `default binding`, of `either` the `global object` or `undefined`, depending on `strict mode`.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!

var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

bar(); // "oops, global"
```

* `bar` appears to be a reference to `obj.foo`, in fact, it's really just another reference to `foo` itself. Moreover, the call-site is what matters, and the call-site is `bar()`, which is a plain, un-decorated call and thus the *default binding* applies.

* The [...] more unexpected way this occurs is when we consider passing a callback function:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

function doFoo(fn) {
	// `fn` is just another reference to `foo`

	fn(); // <-- call-site!
}

var obj = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

doFoo( obj.foo ); // "oops, global"
```

* passing a function (me: as an argument), [...] an `implicit reference assignment`, so the end result is the same as the previous snippet.

* `Event handlers` [...] forcing your callback to have a `this` which points to [...] the `DOM element` that triggered the event.
### Explicit Binding
* want to `force` a function call to use a particular object for the `this` binding, `without` putting a `property function reference on the object`?

* functions have `call(..)` and `apply(..)` methods [...] both take, as their `first parameter`, an `object` to use for the `this`, and then `invoke` the function with that `this` specified.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.call( obj ); // 2
```

* If you pass a [...] `primitive value` (of type `string`, `boolean`, or `number`) as the `this` binding, the primitive value is `wrapped` in its `object-form` (`new String(..)`, `new Boolean(..)`, or `new Number(..)` [...]). This is often referred to as "`boxing`".

#### Hard Binding
```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

var bar = function() {
	foo.call( obj );
};

bar(); // 2
setTimeout( bar, 100 ); // 2

// `bar` hard binds `foo`'s `this` to `obj`
// so that it cannot be overriden
bar.call( window ); // 2
```

* (me: when `apply` is helpful).

```js
function foo(something) {
	console.log( this.a, something );
	return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

var bar = function() {
	return foo.apply( obj, arguments );
};

var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
console.log( b ); // 5
```

* `ES5`: `Function.prototype.bind`.

```js
function foo(something) {
	console.log( this.a, something );
	return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

var bar = foo.bind( obj );

var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
console.log( b ); // 5
```

* As of `ES6` [...] function produced by `bind(..)` has a `.name` property [...] For example: `bar = foo.bind(..)` should have a `bar.name` value of `"bound foo"`, which is the `function call name` [...] `show up in a stack trace`.

#### API Call "Contexts"
* many new `built-in functions` in the `JavaScript` [...] provide an `optional parameter`, usually called "`context`" [...] for you not having to use `bind(..)` to ensure your `callback function` uses a particular `this`.

```js
function foo(el) {
	console.log( el, this.id );
}

var obj = {
	id: "awesome"
};

// use `obj` as `this` for `foo(..)` calls
[1, 2, 3].forEach( foo, obj ); // 1 awesome  2 awesome  3 awesome
```

### `new` Binding
* `The fourth` and final rule for `this` binding.

* JavaScript has a `new` operator [...] `However`, there [...] is `no connection` to `class-oriented`.

* `any [...] function` [...] can be called with `new` in front of it [...] makes that `function call` a `constructor call` [...] there's really no such thing as "`constructor functions`", but rather `construction calls` `of functions`.

* When a function is invoked with `new` in front of it, otherwise known as a `constructor call`, the following things are done automatically:
  1. a brand new `object` is created (aka, constructed).
  2. `newly constructed object` is `[[Prototype]]`-`linked`.
  3. `newly constructed object` is set as the `this` binding for `that function call`.
  4. `unless` the function `returns` its own alternate `object`, the [...] `function call` will `automatically return` the `newly constructed object`.

* **So `new` is the `final way` that a `function call`'s `this` can be bound.** We'll call this `new binding`.

## Everything In Order
* the `default binding` is the `lowest priority` rule of the `4`. So we'll just set that one aside.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj1 = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 3,
	foo: foo
};

obj1.foo(); // 2
obj2.foo(); // 3

obj1.foo.call( obj2 ); // 3
obj2.foo.call( obj1 ); // 2
```

* So, `explicit binding` takes precedence over `implicit binding`.

```js
function foo(something) {
	this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {
	foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {};

obj1.foo( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

obj1.foo.call( obj2, 3 );
console.log( obj2.a ); // 3

var bar = new obj1.foo( 4 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( bar.a ); // 4
```

* OK, `new binding` is `more precedent than` `implicit binding`.

* `Note:` `new` and `call`/`apply` `cannot` be used together, so `new foo.call(obj1)` is `not allowed` (me: `throw a Type error`).

```js
function foo(something) {
	this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {};

var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
bar( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

var baz = new bar( 3 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( baz.a ); // 3
```

* (me: `new binding` is `more precedent than` `explicit binding`.)

* One of the capabilities of `bind(..)` is that `any arguments` `passed after` the first `this` binding argument are `defaulted` [...] arguments to the `underlying function`.

```js
function foo(p1,p2) {
	this.val = p1 + p2;
}

// using `null` here because we don't care about
// the `this` hard-binding in this scenario, and
// it will be overridden by the `new` call anyway!
var bar = foo.bind( null, "p1" );

var baz = new bar( "p2" );

baz.val; // p1p2
```

### Determining `this`
* Now, we can summarize the rules for determining `this` [...] in their `order of precedence`. Ask these questions in this order, and stop when the first rule applies.

  1. Is the function called with `new` (`new binding`)? If so, `this` is the newly constructed object.

      `var bar = new foo()`

  2. Is the function called with `call` or `apply` (`explicit binding`), [...] `bind`? If so, `this` is the explicitly specified object.

      `var bar = foo.call( obj2 )`

  3. Is the function called `with a context` (`implicit binding`), [...] an `owning` or `containing object`? If so, `this` is `that` context object.

      `var bar = obj1.foo()`

  4. Otherwise, default the `this` (`default binding`). If in `strict mode`, pick `undefined`, otherwise pick the `global` object.

      `var bar = foo()`

* That's `all it takes` to understand the rules of `this` binding for normal function calls. Well... `almost`.

## Binding Exceptions
* there are some `exceptions` to the "rules".

### Ignored `this`
* If you pass `null` or `undefined` as a `this` binding parameter to `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, those values are effectively ignored, and instead the `default binding` rule applies to the invocation.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo.call( null ); // 2
```

* there's a [...] `danger` in always using `null` when you don't care about the `this` binding. If you ever use that against a `function call` (for instance, a `third-party library function` [...]), and that function `does` make a `this` reference [...] it might inadvertently reference (or worse, `mutate`!) the `global` object (`window` in the browser).

#### Safer `this`
* "`safer`" practice is to pass a specifically set up object for `this` which is guaranteed not to [...] create [...] `side effects` in your program. Borrowing terminology from `networking` (and the `military`), we can create a "`DMZ`" [...] object [...] a `completely empty` [...] insulates our program's `global` object from `side-effects`.

* the `easiest way` to set it up as `totally empty` is `Object.create(null)` (see Chapter 5). `Object.create(null)` is similar to `{ }`, but `without` the `delegation` to `Object.prototype`, so it's "`more empty`" than just `{ }`.

### Indirection
* `indirect references` occur is from an assignment:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;
var o = { a: 3, foo: foo };
var p = { a: 4 };

o.foo(); // 3
(p.foo = o.foo)(); // 2

// (me)
p.foo() // 4
```

### Softening Binding
## Lexical `this`
* `ES6` introduces a special kind of function [...] `arrow-function` [...] Instead of using the four standard `this` rules, `arrow-functions` adopt the `this` binding from the `enclosing (function or global) scope`.

```js
function foo() {
	// return an arrow function
	return (a) => {
		// `this` here is lexically adopted from `foo()`
		console.log( this.a );
	};
}

var obj1 = {
	a: 2
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 3
};

var bar = foo.call( obj1 );
bar.call( obj2 ); // 2, not 3!
```

* The arrow-function created in `foo()` `lexically captures` whatever `foo()`s `this` is `at its call-time`. Since `foo()` was `this`-bound to `obj1`, `bar` (a reference to the `returned arrow-function`) will also be `this`-bound to `obj1`.

* The `lexical binding` of an `arrow-function` `cannot be overridden` (`even with` `new`!).

* most common use-case will likely be in the use of `callbacks`.

```js
function foo() {
	setTimeout(() => {
		// `this` here is lexically adopted from `foo()`
		console.log( this.a );
	},100);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.call( obj ); // 2
```

## Review (TL;DR)
* order of precedence (me: of 4 `this` binding rules):
  1. Called with `new`? Use the newly constructed object.

  2. Called with `call` or `apply` (or `bind`)? Use the specified object.

  3. Called with a context object owning the call? Use that context object.

  4. Default: `undefined` in `strict mode`, global object otherwise.

# Chapter 3: Objects
## Syntax

* Objects come in two forms:

* The `literal syntax`.

```js
var myObj = {
	key: value
	// ...
};
```

* The `constructed form`.

```js
var myObj = new Object();
myObj.key = value;
```

## Type
* `6` `primary` types.

* `string`
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `null`
* `undefined`
* `object`

* `simple primitives` (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`) are `not` [...] `objects`.

* `null` is sometimes referred to as an `object type`, but this `misconception` stems from a `bug in the language` which causes `typeof null` to return the string `"object"` incorrectly [...] `null` is its own primitive type.

* there *are* a few `special object sub-types`, which we can refer to as `complex primitives`.

* `function` is a `sub-type of object` (technically, a "`callable object`").

* `Arrays` are also a form of objects, with `extra behavior`. The organization of contents in arrays is [...] more structured than for general objects.

### Built-in Objects
* There are `several other` `object` `sub-types`, usually referred to as `built-in objects`.
  * `String`
  * `Number`
  * `Boolean`
  * `Object`
  * `Function`
  * `Array`
  * `Date`
  * `RegExp`
  * `Error`

* `these` are [...] just `built-in functions` [...] can be used as `a constructor` ([...] a function call with the `new` operator [...]).

```js
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive;							// "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String;					// false

var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );
typeof strObject; 								// "object"
strObject instanceof String;					// true

// inspect the object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call( strObject );	// [object String]
```

* We'll see in detail in a later chapter exactly how the `Object.prototype.toString...` bit works, but briefly [...] you can see it reveals that `strObject` is an object [...] created by the `String` constructor.

* The primitive value `"I am a string"` is `not an object`, it's a `primitive literal` and `immutable` value. To perform operations on it, such as checking its length [...] a `String` object is required.

* the language `automatically` coerces a `"string"` primitive to a `String` object `when necessary`.

```js
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";

console.log( strPrimitive.length );			// 13

console.log( strPrimitive.charAt( 3 ) );	// "m"
```

* In both cases, we call a `property` or `method` `on a string primitive` [...] the engine `automatically` coerces it to a `String` object, so that the `property/method access` works.

* `null` and `undefined` have `no object wrapper` form [...] By contrast, `Date` values can `only` be created with their `constructed object form`.

* `Object`s, `Array`s, `Function`s, and `RegExp`s [...] are all objects `regardless of` whether the `literal` or `constructed form` is used.

* `Error` [...] can be created with the `constructed form` `new Error(..)`, but it's often unnecessary.

## Contents
* It's important to note that while we say "`contents`" which implies that these values are `actually` stored inside the object, that's merely an appearance [...] What is stored [...] are [...] `property names`, which act as `pointers` (technically, `references`) to `where the values are stored`.

* The `.a` syntax is usually referred to as `"property" access`, whereas the ["a"] syntax is usually referred to as `"key" access` [...] they both access the same location, and will pull out the same value [...] so the terms can be used interchangeably. We will use the `most common term`, "`property access`" from here on.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.a;		// 2

myObject["a"];	// 2
```

* property names are `always` `strings`. If you use any other value besides a `string` (primitive) as the property, it will first be `converted to a string` [...] includes numbers, which are commonly used as `array indexes`.

```js
var myObject = { };

myObject[true] = "foo";
myObject[3] = "bar";
myObject[myObject] = "baz";

myObject["true"];				// "foo"
myObject["3"];					// "bar"
myObject["[object Object]"];	// "baz"
```

### Computed Property Names
* `ES6` adds `computed property names`:

```js
var prefix = "foo";

var myObject = {
	[prefix + "bar"]: "hello",
	[prefix + "baz"]: "world"
};

myObject["foobar"]; // hello
myObject["foobaz"]; // world
```

* most common usage of `computed property names` will probably be for ES6 `Symbol`s [...] `new primitive data type` [...] You will be strongly discouraged from working with the `actual value` of a `Symbol` [...] `different` `between different JS engines` [...] [...] name of the `Symbol`, like `Symbol.Something` (just a `made up name`!), will be what you use:

```js
var myObject = {
	[Symbol.Something]: "hello world"
};
```

### Property vs. Method
* in other languages, `functions` which `belong to` `objects` (aka, "`classes`") are referred to as "`methods`", it's `not uncommon` to hear, "`method access`" as opposed to "`property access`".

* `The specification` makes this `same distinction`, interestingly.

* `Technically`, `functions` `never` "belong" to `objects`.

* conclusion [...] "`function`" and "`method`" are `interchangeable` in JavaScript.

* Even when you declare a `function expression` as part of the `object-literal`, that function `doesn't` [...] `belong` [...] to the object -- still just `multiple references` to the `same function object`:

```js
var myObject = {
	foo: function foo() {
		console.log( "foo" );
	}
};

var someFoo = myObject.foo;

someFoo;		// function foo(){..}

myObject.foo;	// function foo(){..}
```

### Arrays
* `are` `objects` [...] you can [...] add properties onto the array:

```js
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];

myArray.baz = "baz";

myArray.length;	// 3

myArray.baz;	// "baz"
```

* `Notice` that adding `named properties` [...] does `not` change the reported `length` of the array.

* You `could` use an array as a plain `key/value object`, and never add any `numeric indices` [...] a `bad idea` because arrays have [...] `optimizations` specific to their `intended use`, and `likewise` with `plain objects`. Use objects to store `key/value` pairs, and arrays to store values `at numeric indices`.

* **Be careful:** If you try to add a property to an array, but the `property name` `looks` like a `number`, it will end up [...] as a `numeric index` (thus `modifying the array contents`):

```js
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];

myArray["3"] = "baz";

myArray.length;	// 4

myArray[3];		// "baz"
```

### Duplicating Objects
* One of the most commonly requested features [...] is how to duplicate an object [...] like [...] a built-in `copy()` method [...] it's a little more complicated [...] because it's not fully clear `what`, `by default`, should be the `algorithm for the duplication`.

```js
function anotherFunction() { /*..*/ }

var anotherObject = {
	c: true
};

var anotherArray = [];

var myObject = {
	a: 2,
	b: anotherObject,	// reference, not a copy!
	c: anotherArray,	// another reference!
	d: anotherFunction
};

anotherArray.push( anotherObject, myObject );
```

* Firstly, we should answer if it should be a `shallow` or `deep` copy.

* (me: for) `a shallow copy` [...] `ES6` has now defined `Object.assign(..)` for this task. `Object.assign(..)` takes a `target object` as its `first parameter`, and `one or more` `source objects` as its `subsequent parameters`. It `iterates` over all the `enumerable` (see below), `owned keys` [...] on the `source object(s`) and `copies` them (via `=` assignment `only`) to `target`. It also [...] returns `target`.

```js
var newObj = Object.assign( {}, myObject );

newObj.a;						// 2
newObj.b === anotherObject;		// true
newObj.c === anotherArray;		// true
newObj.d === anotherFunction;	// true
```

### Property Descriptors
* as of `ES5`, `all` properties are described in terms of a **property descriptor**.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a" );
// {
//    value: 2,
//    writable: true,
//    enumerable: true,
//    configurable: true
// }
```

* use `Object.defineProperty(..)` to `add a new property`, `or` modify an `existing one` (`if` it's `configurable`!), `with` the `desired characteristics`.

```js
var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 2,
	writable: true,
	configurable: true,
	enumerable: true
} );

myObject.a; // 2
```

* you generally wouldn't use this `manual approach` `unless` you wanted to modify [...] the `descriptor characteristics` from `its normal behavior`.

#### Writable
* The ability for you to `change the value` of a property.

```js
var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 2,
	writable: false, // not writable!
	configurable: true,
	enumerable: true
} );

myObject.a = 3;

myObject.a; // 2
```

* `modification` of the `value` `silently failed`. If we try in `strict mode`, we get (me: a `TypeError error`):

#### Configurable
* `As long as` a property is currently `configurable`, we can modify its `descriptor definition`, using [...] `defineProperty(..)`.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.a = 3;
myObject.a;					// 3

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 4,
	writable: true,
	configurable: false,	// not configurable!
	enumerable: true
} );

myObject.a;					// 4
myObject.a = 5;
myObject.a;					// 5

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 6,
	writable: true,
	configurable: true,
	enumerable: true
} ); // TypeError
```

* The final `defineProperty(..)` call results in a `TypeError`, `regardless of` `strict mode` [...] Be careful: as you can see, changing `configurable` to `false` is a `one-way action, and cannot be undone!`.

* There's a [...] `exception` [...]: `even if` the property is already `configurable:false`, `writable` `can always be changed` from `true` to `false` `without error`, but `not back` to `true` if already `false`.

* Another thing `configurable:false` `prevents` is the ability to use the `delete` operator to `remove an existing property`.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.a;				// 2
delete myObject.a;
myObject.a;				// undefined

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 2,
	writable: true,
	configurable: false,
	enumerable: true
} );

myObject.a;				// 2
delete myObject.a;
myObject.a;				// 2
```

#### Enumerable
* controls if a property will `show up` in certain object-property `enumerations` [...] even though it's still [...] `accessible`.

* `All` normal `user-defined properties` are `defaulted` to `enumerable`.

### Immutability
* note that `all` of these approaches create `shallow immutability`. That is, they affect `only` the `object` and `its direct property characteristics`. If an object has (me: `properties` `referencing to other objects` (`array`, `object`, `function`, etc), the `contents` of these objects are `not affected`, and `remain mutable`).

#### Object Constant
* By combining `writable:false` and `configurable:false`, you can essentially create a `constant` (`cannot be` `changed`, `redefined` or `deleted`) as an `object property`:

```js
var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "FAVORITE_NUMBER", {
	value: 42,
	writable: false,
	configurable: false
} );
```

#### Prevent Extensions
* If you want to prevent an object from `having new properties added` to it, `but` otherwise leave the `rest of the object's properties` alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(..)`:

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

Object.preventExtensions( myObject );

myObject.b = 3;
myObject.b; // undefined

// (me: the rest of the object's properties are let alone)
myObject.a = 3
myObject.a // 3
```

* In `strict mode`, it throws a `TypeError`.

#### Seal
* `Object.seal(..)` [...] takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions(..)` on it, but also marks `all its existing properties` as `configurable:false`.

* So, `not only` can you `not` add any more properties [...] you also `cannot` `reconfigure` or `delete` any `existing properties` (`though` you `can still modify` their values).

#### Freeze
* `Object.freeze(..)` [...] takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal(..)` on it, but it also marks `all "data accessor" properties` as `writable:false`, so that `their values` `cannot be changed` [...] `though`, as mentioned above, the contents of any `referenced other objects` are `unaffected`.

### `[[Get]]`
```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.a; // 2
```

* The `myObject.a` is a `property access`, but it doesn't `just` look in `myObject` for a property of the name `a`, as it might seem.

* the code above [...] performs a `[[Get]]` operation (kinda like a function call: `[[Get]]()`) on the `myObject`. The `default built-in` `[[Get]]` operation [...] inspects the object for a property of the `requested name`, and [...] return the value accordingly [...] if it does `not` find a property [...] We will examine in `Chapter 5` what happens `next` (`traversal` of the `[[Prototype]]` chain, `if any`).

* if (me: `[[Get]]`)(it) `cannot` [...] come up with a value for the `requested property`, it instead returns the value `undefined`.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.b; // undefined
```

* Inspecting `only the value` results, you `cannot` distinguish whether a property `exists` and holds the `explicit value` `undefined`, or whether the property `does not exist` [...] `However`, we will see shortly how you `can` distinguish these two scenarios.

### `[[Put]]`
* When invoking `[[Put]]`, how it behaves differs based on a number of factors:
  * If the property is `present`, the `[[Put]]` algorithm will roughly check:
    1. Is the property an (me: read below)(`accessor descriptor`) (see "Getters & Setters" section below)? **If so, call the setter, if any.**
    2. Is the property a `data descriptor` with `writable` of `false`? **If so, silently fail in `non-strict mode`, or throw `TypeError` in `strict mode`.**
    3. `Otherwise`, set the value to the existing property.

  * If the property is `not yet present` [...] the `[[Put]]` operation is even more [...] complex. We will revisit this [...] in `Chapter 5`.

### Getters & Setters
* The default `[[Put]]` and `[[Get]]` operations for objects `completely control` how values `are set` to `existing or new properties`, or `retrieved` `from existing properties`, respectively.

* `ES5` introduced a way to `override` `part of these default operations`, `not` on an `object level` but a `per-property level`
  * `Getters` `are properties` which actually call a `hidden function` to `retrieve a value`.
  * `Setters` `are properties` which actually call a `hidden function` to `set a value`.

* When [...] a property [...] have either a `getter` or a `setter` or `both`, its definition becomes an "`accessor descriptor`" (as `opposed to` a "`data descriptor`"). For `accessor-descriptors`, the `value` and `writable` `characteristics of the descriptor` are [...] `ignored`, and instead JS considers the `set` and `get` `characteristics of the property` (`as well as` `configurable` and `enumerable`).

```js
var myObject = {
	// define a getter for `a`
	get a() {
		return 2;
	}
};

Object.defineProperty(
	myObject,	// target
	"b",		// property name
	{			// descriptor
		// define a getter for `b`
		get: function(){ return this.a * 2 },

		// make sure `b` shows up as an object property
		enumerable: true
	}
);

myObject.a; // 2

myObject.b; // 4
```

* Either through `object-literal` syntax with `get a() { .. }` or through `explicit definition` with `defineProperty(..)` [...] we created a property on the object that [...] doesn't hold a value [...] whose `access` automatically results in a `hidden function call` to the `getter function`, with whatever value it `returns` being the result of the `property access`.

```js
var myObject = {
	// define a getter for `a`
	get a() {
		return 2;
	}
};

myObject.a = 3;

myObject.a; // 2
```

* Since we `only` defined a `getter` for `a`, if we try to `set the value` of `a` `later`, the set operation [...] will just `silently` `throw the assignment away`.

* properties should also be defined with `setters`, which `override` the default `[[Put]]` operation [...] You will almost certainly want to always declare both `getter` and `setter`.

```js
var myObject = {
	// define a getter for `a`
	get a() {
		return this._a_;
	},

	// define a setter for `a`
	set a(val) {
		this._a_ = val * 2;
	}
};

myObject.a = 2;

myObject.a; // 4
```

### Existence
```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

("a" in myObject);				// true
("b" in myObject);				// false

myObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" );	// true
myObject.hasOwnProperty( "b" );	// false
```

* The `in` operator will check [...] (me: for the `existence of a property name` in the object), or if it `exists` at any `higher level` of the `[[Prototype]]` chain.
* `hasOwnProperty(..)` checks to see if `only` `myObject` `has the property or not`, and will `not` consult the `[[Prototype]]` chain.

* `hasOwnProperty(..)` is `accessible` for `all normal objects` via `delegation to` `Object.prototype` (see Chapter 5). But it's possible to create an object that `does not` link to `Object.prototype` (via `Object.create(null)` -- see Chapter 5). In this case, a method call like `myObject.hasOwnProperty(..)` would fail.

* In that scenario, a more robust [...] is `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(myObject,"a")`, which `borrows` the base `hasOwnProperty(..)` method and uses `explicit` `this` binding (see Chapter 2) to apply it against our `myObject`.

#### Enumeration
```js
var myObject = { };

Object.defineProperty(
	myObject,
	"a",
	// make `a` enumerable, as normal
	{ enumerable: true, value: 2 }
);

Object.defineProperty(
	myObject,
	"b",
	// make `b` NON-enumerable
	{ enumerable: false, value: 3 }
);

myObject.b; // 3
("b" in myObject); // true
myObject.hasOwnProperty( "b" ); // true

// .......

for (var k in myObject) {
	console.log( k, myObject[k] );
}
// "a" 2
```

* `myObject.b` [...] `exists` and has an accessible value, but it doesn't show up in a `for..in` loop.

* `for..in` loops applied to arrays [...] will include not only all the `numeric indices`, but also any `enumerable` properties. It's a good idea to use `for..in` loops `only` on `objects`, and traditional `for` loops with `numeric index iteration` for the values stored in arrays.

* Another way that enumerable and non-enumerable properties can be distinguished:

```js
var myObject = { };

Object.defineProperty(
	myObject,
	"a",
	// make `a` enumerable, as normal
	{ enumerable: true, value: 2 }
);

Object.defineProperty(
	myObject,
	"b",
	// make `b` non-enumerable
	{ enumerable: false, value: 3 }
);

myObject.propertyIsEnumerable( "a" ); // true
myObject.propertyIsEnumerable( "b" ); // false

Object.keys( myObject ); // ["a"]
Object.getOwnPropertyNames( myObject ); // ["a", "b"]
```

* `propertyIsEnumerable(..)` tests whether the given property name exists `directly` on the object and is also `enumerable:true`.
* `Object.keys(..)` returns an array of all `enumerable` `properties`.
* whereas `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(..)` returns an array of `all` properties.

* `Object.keys(..)` and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(..)` `both` inspect `only` the `direct object specified`.

## Iteration
* The `for..in` loop iterates over the list of `enumerable properties` on an object (`including` its `[[Prototype]]` chain). But what if you instead want to iterate over the values?

* `As contrasted with` iterating over an array's `indices` in a `numerically ordered` way [...] the `order` of iteration over an `object's properties` [...] may vary between different `JS engines`.

* if you want to iterate over the values `directly` [...] `ES6` adds a `for..of` loop syntax for iterating over `arrays` (and `objects`, `if` the object defines its own custom `iterator`):

```js
var myArray = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

for (var v of myArray) {
	console.log( v );
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

* The `for..of` loop asks for an `iterator` object (from a default `internal function` known as `@@iterator` [...]) of the `thing` `to be iterated`, and the `loop` then iterates over the `successive return values` from calling that `iterator object`'s `next()` method, `once` for `each loop iteration`.

* let's `manually` iterate the array, using the built-in `@@iterator`, to see how it works:

```js
var myArray = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
var it = myArray[Symbol.iterator]();

it.next(); // { value:1, done:false }
it.next(); // { value:2, done:false }
it.next(); // { value:3, done:false }
it.next(); // { done:true }
```

* always [...] reference such special properties (me: like `@@iterator`) by `Symbol` name reference `instead` of by the [...] `value it [...] hold`. Also [...] `@@iterator` is `not the iterator object` itself, but a `function` that `returns the iterator object`.

* Notice the value `3` was returned with a `done:false` [...] You have to call the `next()` a `fourth time` ([...] the `for..of` loop [...] automatically does) to get `done:true`.

* `regular objects` `do not have` a `built-in @@iterator` [...] It is possible to define your own default `@@iterator` for `any object`.

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2,
	b: 3
};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, Symbol.iterator, {
	enumerable: false,
	writable: false,
	configurable: true,
	value: function() {
		var o = this;
		var idx = 0;
		var ks = Object.keys( o );
		return {
			next: function() {
				return {
					value: o[ks[idx++]],
					done: (idx > ks.length)
				};
			}
		};
	}
} );

// iterate `myObject` manually
var it = myObject[Symbol.iterator]();
it.next(); // { value:2, done:false }
it.next(); // { value:3, done:false }
it.next(); // { value:undefined, done:true }

// iterate `myObject` with `for..of`
for (var v of myObject) {
	console.log( v );
}
// 2
// 3
```

* We used `Object.defineProperty(..)` to define our custom `@@iterator` [...] so we could make it `non-enumerable`.
* `but` [...] we could have declared it `directly`, like `var myObject = { a:2, b:3, [Symbol.iterator]: function(){ /* .. */ } }`.

## Review (TL;DR)
* Properties don't have to contain values -- they can be "`accessor properties`" (me: `getters` and `setters`).

# Chapter 4: Mixing (Up) "Class" Objects
## Class Theory
* `OO` or `class oriented programming` stresses that data [...] has associated `behavior` [...] so `proper design` is to [...] encapsulate [...] the data and the behavior together.

* `Classes` also imply a way of `classifying` [...] Let's [...] looking at a commonly cited example. A `car` can be described as a `specific implementation` of a `more general` "class" [...] called a `vehicle`.

* The definition of `Vehicle` might include things like [...] the ability to carry people, etc. [...] all be the `behaviors`. What we define in `Vehicle` is all the stuff that is `common` [...] different types of vehicles (the "`planes`, `trains`, and `automobiles`").

* we define that capability `once` in `Vehicle`, and then when we define `Car`, we simply indicate that it "`inherits`" (or "`extends`") the base definition from `Vehicle`.

* Another key concept with classes is "`polymorphism`" [...] idea (me: is) that a general behavior from a `parent class` `can be overridden` in a `child class` [...] In fact, `relative polymorphism` lets us `reference` the `base behavior` `from the overridden behavior`.

### "Class" Design Pattern
* it's most common to [...] an assumption that [...] `OO` is a given foundation for *all* (proper) code.

* "`procedural programming`" as a way of describing code which only consists of `procedures` (aka, `functions`) calling `other functions` [...] You may have been taught that `classes` were the *proper* way to transform `procedural-style` "`spaghetti code`" into well-formed, well-organized code.

* (me: in) "`functional programming`" [...] `classes` are just one of several common `design patterns`.

* languages (like Java) don't give you the choice [...] everything's a class. Other languages like `C/C++` or `PHP` give you both procedural and class-oriented syntaxes.

### JavaScript "Classes"
* But does [...] JavaScript actually *has* classes? [...] **No.**

* classes are an `optional pattern` in software design, and you have the choice to use them in JavaScript or not

## Class Mechanics
### Building
* A class is a `blue-print`. To actually `get` an object we can interact with, we must build (aka, "`instantiate`") something `from the class`. The end result of such "`construction`" is an `object`, [...] an "`instance`", which we can directly `call methods` on and `access` any public data properties from [...] This object is a `copy` of all the (me: contents)(characteristics) described by the class (me: to prevent modifications on `instances' contents` from being reflected to their base class. in the other words,) [...] A class is `instantiated into` `object form` by a `copy operation`.

### Constructor
* Instances of classes are `constructed` by a special method of the class [...] a `constructor`. This method's [...] job is to (me: `receive arguments`, if there are ones and) `initialize` any information (`state`) the instance will need.

## Class Inheritance
* In class-oriented languages [...] you can define another class that **inherits** from the first class.

* once a child class is defined [...] The child class contains an initial `copy` of the behavior from the parent, but can then `override` any `inherited behavior` and `even define new behavior`.

```js
class Vehicle {
	engines = 1

	ignition() {
		output( "Turning on my engine." )
	}

	drive() {
		ignition()
		output( "Steering and moving forward!" )
	}
}

class Car inherits Vehicle {
	wheels = 4

	drive() {
		inherited:drive()
		output( "Rolling on all ", wheels, " wheels!" )
	}
}

class SpeedBoat inherits Vehicle {
	engines = 2

	ignition() {
		output( "Turning on my ", engines, " engines." )
	}

	pilot() {
		inherited:drive()
		output( "Speeding through the water with ease!" )
	}
}
```

* For clarity [...] `constructors` for these classes have been `omitted`.

### Polymorphism
* `Polymorphism` is a much broader topic than we will exhaust here, but our current "`relative`" semantics refers to one particular aspect: the idea that `any method` can reference `another method` (of the `same` or `different name`) at a `higher level` of the `inheritance hierarchy`. We say "`relative`" because we don't [...] define which `inheritance level` (aka, `class`) we want to access, but rather `relatively` reference it by [...] "`look one level up`".

* In many languages, the keyword `super` is used, in place of this example's `inherited:`, which leans on the idea that a "`super class`" is the `parent/ancestor` of the current class.

* Another aspect of polymorphism is that a `method name` can have `multiple definitions` at `different levels of the inheritance chain` [...] We see two occurrences of that behavior in our example above: `drive()` is defined in both `Vehicle` and `Car`, and `ignition()` is defined in both `Vehicle` and `SpeedBoat`.

* Another thing that [...] `class-oriented` languages give you via `super` is a direct way for the constructor of a `child class` to reference the constructor of `its parent class`.

* Inside `pilot()`, a [...] reference is made to [...] `Vehicle`s version of `drive()`. `But` that `drive()` references an `ignition()` method `just by name` [...] Which version of `ignition()` will the language engine use, the one from `Vehicle` or the one from `SpeedBoat`? It uses the `SpeedBoat` version of `ignition()`. `If` you `were` to instantiate `Vehicle` class [...] and then call `its` `drive()`, the language engine would instead just use `Vehicle`s `ignition()` method.

* When classes `are inherited`, there is a way `for the classes themselves` (`not` the `object instances` created from them!) to [...] reference the class `inherited from`, and this [...] `reference` is usually called `super`.

* `Class inheritance implies copies` (me: read a more comprehensive explaination in the `Mixing Copies` section below).

### Multiple Inheritance
* Some `class-oriented` languages allow you to specify more than one "`parent`" class to "`inherit`" from. `Multiple-inheritance` means that each parent class definition is `copied` into the `child class` [...] However, there are certainly some complicating questions [...] arise.

* `JavaScript` [...] does not provide a `native` mechanism for "`multiple inheritance`".

## Mixins
* JavaScript's object mechanism does not *automatically* perform copy behavior when you "inherit" or "instantiate". Plainly, there are no "classes" in JavaScript to instantiate, only objects. And objects don't get copied to other objects, they get *linked together* (more on that in Chapter 5).

* let's examine how JS developers **fake** the *missing* `copy behavior` of classes in JavaScript: `mixins`. We'll look at two types of "mixin": **explicit** and **implicit**.

### Explicit Mixins
* we can [...] create a utility that `manually copies`. Such a utility is often called `extend(..)` by many `libraries/frameworks`, but we will call it `mixin(..)` here.

```js
// vastly simplified `mixin(..)` example:
function mixin( sourceObj, targetObj ) {
	for (var key in sourceObj) {
		// only copy if not already present
		if (!(key in targetObj)) {
			targetObj[key] = sourceObj[key];
		}
	}

	return targetObj;
}

var Vehicle = {
	engines: 1,

	ignition: function() {
		console.log( "Turning on my engine." );
	},

	drive: function() {
		this.ignition();
		console.log( "Steering and moving forward!" );
	}
};

var Car = mixin( Vehicle, {
	wheels: 4,

	drive: function() {
		Vehicle.drive.call( this );
		console.log( "Rolling on all " + this.wheels + " wheels!" );
	}
} );
```

* there are `no classes` in JavaScript. `Vehicle` and `Car` are just objects that we make copies from and to, respectively.

* `Car` now has a `copy` of the properties [...] from `Vehicle`. `Technically`, `functions` are `not actually duplicated`, but rather `references` to the functions are copied.

* `Car` *already* had a `drive` property (function), so `that property reference` was `not overridden`.

#### "Polymorphism" Revisited
* Let's examine this statement: `Vehicle.drive.call( this )`. This is what I call "`explicit pseudo-polymorphism`". Recall in our previous `pseudo-code` this line was `inherited:drive()`, which we called "`relative` polymorphism".

* JavaScript `does not` have (`prior` to `ES6` [...]) a facility for `relative` `polymorphism`. So, **because both `Car` and `Vehicle` had a function of the same name: `drive()`**, to distinguish a call [...] we must make an `absolute` (`not relative`) reference. We explicitly specify the `Vehicle` object by name, and call the `drive()` function on it.

* But if we said `Vehicle.drive()`, the `this` binding for that function call would be the `Vehicle` [...] So, instead we use `.call( this )` [...] to ensure that `drive()` is executed in the `context` of the `Car` object.

* In `class-oriented languages` [...] the `linkage` between `Car` and `Vehicle` is established once, at the top of the class definition, which makes for only `one place` to maintain such relationships.

* `shadowing` [...] creates brittle manual/explicit linkage **in `every single function` where you need such a (`pseudo`-)polymorphic reference** [...] [...] is [...] more complex [...] harder-to-maintain code. **`Explicit` `pseudo`-polymorphism should be avoided wherever possible**.

#### Mixing Copies
* Recall the `mixin(..)` utility from above [...] we [...] explicitly copied the `non-overlapping` contents of `Vehicle` into `Car`. The name "`mixin`" comes from an alternate way of explaining the task: `Car` has `Vehicle`s contents **mixed-in** [...] As a result of the `copy operation`, `Car` will operate somewhat `separately` from `Vehicle`. If you add a property onto `Car`, it `will not affect` `Vehicle`, and `vice versa`.

* There are still some subtle ways the `two objects` can "`affect`" each other even `after copying`, such as if they both share a reference to a [...] `object` (such as an `array`).

* Since the two objects also share `references` to their common `functions` (me: since) [...] JavaScript functions can't really be duplicated (in a [...] reliable way) [...] you end up with instead is a **duplicated reference** to the same `shared function object` [...] If you modified one of the shared **function objects** [...] by adding properties on top of it, for instance, both `Vehicle` and `Car` would be "`affected`" via the `shared reference`.

* `mix-in` two or more objects into your target object, you can **partially emulate** the behavior of "`multiple inheritance`".

#### Parasitic Inheritance
* A variation on this explicit mixin pattern, which is both in some ways explicit and in other ways implicit, is called "`parasitic inheritance`".

```js
// "Traditional JS Class" `Vehicle`
function Vehicle() {
	this.engines = 1;
}
Vehicle.prototype.ignition = function() {
	console.log( "Turning on my engine." );
};
Vehicle.prototype.drive = function() {
	this.ignition();
	console.log( "Steering and moving forward!" );
};

// "Parasitic Class" `Car`
function Car() {
	// first, `car` is a `Vehicle`
	var car = new Vehicle();

	// now, let's modify our `car` to specialize it
	car.wheels = 4;

	// save a privileged reference to `Vehicle::drive()`
	var vehDrive = car.drive;

	// override `Vehicle::drive()`
	car.drive = function() {
		vehDrive.call( this );
		console.log( "Rolling on all " + this.wheels + " wheels!" );
	};

	return car;
}

var myCar = new Car();

myCar.drive();
// Turning on my engine.
// Steering and moving forward!
// Rolling on all 4 wheels!
```

* when we call `new Car()`, a new object is created and referenced by `Car`s `this` reference [...] But since we don't use that object, and instead return our own `car` object, the initially created object is just `discarded`. So, `Car()` could be called without the `new` keyword, and the functionality above would be `identical`, but `without the wasted object creation/garbage-collection`.

### Implicit Mixins
Implicit mixins are closely related to *explicit pseudo-polymorphism* as explained previously. As such, they come with the same caveats and warnings.

Consider this code:

```js
var Something = {
	cool: function() {
		this.greeting = "Hello World";
		this.count = this.count ? this.count + 1 : 1;
	}
};

Something.cool();
Something.greeting; // "Hello World"
Something.count; // 1

var Another = {
	cool: function() {
		// implicit mixin of `Something` to `Another`
		Something.cool.call( this );
	}
};

Another.cool();
Another.greeting; // "Hello World"
Another.count; // 1 (not shared state with `Something`)
```

* With `Something.cool.call( this )` [...] we essentially "borrow" the function `Something.cool()` and call it `in the context` of `Another` (me: `Another.cool()`) [...] instead of `Something`. The end result is that the assignments that `Something.cool()` makes are applied against the `Another` object rather than the `Something` object [...] **avoid such constructs where possible** to keep cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Review (TL;DR)

# Chapter 5: Prototypes
## `[[Prototype]]`
* Objects in JavaScript have an internal property [...] `[[Prototype]]` [...] a reference to `another object`. `Almost` all objects are given a `non-null value` for this property, `at the time of their creation`.

* `everything` [...] about normal `[[Get]]` and `[[Put]]` behavior does `not apply` if a `Proxy` (me: `ES6`) is involved.

* The default `[[Get]]` operation proceeds to follow the `[[Prototype]]` **link** of the object if it cannot find the requested property (me: `on the object itself`, this operation continues until it either find the property or the `[[Prototype]]` chain `ends`. If no matching property is found the return result from the `[[Get]]` is `undefined`).

```js
var anotherObject = {
	a: 2
};

// create an object linked to `anotherObject`
var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

myObject.a; // 2
```

* We will explain what `Object.create(..)` [...] shortly. For now, just assume it creates an object with the `[[Prototype]]` linkage we're examining to the object `specified` [...] So [...] `myObject` that is now `[[Prototype]]` linked to `anotherObject`.

* `for..in` loop [...] iterate over [...] any property that can be reached via its chain  [...] and is also `enumerable` [...] `in` (me: operator also) check the entire chain of the object (`regardless of` *enumerability*).

```js
var anotherObject = {
	a: 2
};

// create an object linked to `anotherObject`
var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

for (var k in myObject) {
	console.log("found: " + k);
}
// found: a

("a" in myObject); // true
```

### `Object.prototype`
* But *where* exactly does the `[[Prototype]]` chain "end"?

* The (me: `higher-level implementation`)(`top-end`) of every *normal* `[[Prototype]]` chain is the built-in `Object.prototype` [...] includes [...] common utilities used all over JS, because all [...] built-in [...] objects in JavaScript "`descend from`" [...] the `Object.prototype` object.

* Some utilities found here [...] include `.toString()` and `.valueOf()` [...] `.hasOwnProperty(..)` [...] `.isPrototypeOf(..)`.

### Setting & Shadowing Properties
* Back in `Chapter 3`, we mentioned that `setting properties` [...] was more nuanced than just `adding a new property` [...] or changing an existing property's value.

```js
myObject.foo = "bar";
```

* If the `myObject` object already has a [...] property called `foo` `directly` present on it, the `assignment` is as simple as `changing the value of the existing property`.

* If `foo` is not already present directly on `myObject`, the `[[Prototype]]` chain is `traversed`, just like for the `[[Get]]` operation. If `foo` is `not found anywhere` [...] the property `foo` is added `directly` to `myObject` with the specified value.

* `However`, if foo is `already present` somewhere (me: `deeper`)(`higher`) in the chain [...] surprising [...] behavior can occur with the `myObject.foo = "bar"` assignment [...] We will now examine `three scenarios` (me: that could happen).
  1. If a normal `data accessor [...] property` (me: not an `accessor property` which are merely a `getter` or a `setter`, `data accessor property` is just a `normal property`, sometimes called a `data property`) named `foo` is found anywhere (me: `deeper`)(`higher`) on the `[[Prototype]]` chain, **and it's `not` marked as read-only (`writable:false`)** then a new property called `foo` is added directly to `myObject`, resulting in a **shadowed property**.

	```js
	// (me)
	var anotherObject = {
		foo: 2
	};

	var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

	myObject.foo = 3

	console.log(anotherObject); // {foo: 2}
	console.log(myObject); // {foo: 3}: `foo` is directly added to the object `myObject`
	```

	2. If a `foo` is found (me: `deeper`)(`higher`) on the `[[Prototype]]` chain, but it's marked as **read-only (`writable:false`)** [...] (me: and) If the code is running in `strict mode`, an error will be thrown. Otherwise, the (me: assignment)(setting) of the property value will `silently be ignored` [...] **no shadowing occurs**.

	```js
	// (me)
	var anotherObject = {};

	Object.defineProperty(anotherObject, 'foo', {
		value: 2,
		writable: false
	});

	var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

	myObject.foo = 3

	console.log(anotherObject); // {foo: 2}
	console.log(myObject); // {}: no shadowing occurs
	```

	```js
	// (me)
	"use strict";
	var anotherObject = {};

	Object.defineProperty(anotherObject, 'foo', {
		value: 2,
		writable: false
	});

	var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

	myObject.foo = 3

	console.log(anotherObject);
	console.log(myObject);

	// results:
	//
	// TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'foo'
	```
  
	3. If a `foo` is found (`deeper`)`higher` on the `[[Prototype]]` chain and it's a `setter` [...] then the `setter` will `always be called`. No `foo` will be added to [...] `myObject`, nor will the `foo` setter be `redefined`.

	```js
	// (me)
	var anotherObject = {
			_foo: 2,
			set foo(newVal) {
					this._foo = newVal;
			}
	};

	var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

	myObject.foo = 3

	console.log(anotherObject); // {_foo: 2}
	console.log(myObject); // {_foo: 3}: no `foo` is added to `myObject`. Instead, the `foo` setter is called in the context of the object `myObject`
	```

* Most developers assume that assignment of a property (`[[Put]]`) will `always` result in `shadowing` if the property already exists (me: `deeper`)(higher) on the `[[Prototype]]` chain, but as you can see, that's only true in [...] `#1`.

* If you want to shadow `foo` in cases `#2` and `#3`, you `cannot` use `=` assignment [...] `must instead` use `Object.defineProperty(..)` [...] to add `foo` to `myObject`.

* `shadowing` is `more complicated` [...] `than it's worth` [...] See `Chapter 6` for an `alternative design pattern`.

* `Shadowing` can even occur `implicitly`.

```js
var anotherObject = {
	a: 2
};

var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

anotherObject.a; // 2
myObject.a; // 2

anotherObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" ); // true
myObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" ); // false

myObject.a++; // oops, implicit shadowing!

anotherObject.a; // 2
myObject.a; // 3

myObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" ); // true
```

* the `++` operation corresponds to `myObject.a = myObject.a + 1`. The result is `[[Get]]` looking up `a` property via `[[Prototype]]` to get the current value `2` from `anotherObject.a` [...] then `[[Put]]` assigning the `3` value to a `new shadowed property` `a` on `myObject`. Oops!

## "Class"
### "Class" Functions
* `all functions` by default get a `public`, `non-enumerable` [...] property on them called `prototype`, which points at an otherwise arbitrary object.

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

Foo.prototype; // { }
```

* each object `created from calling` `new Foo()` [...] end up [...] `[[Prototype]]-linked` to this "`Foo dot prototype`" `object`.

Let's illustrate:

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

var a = new Foo();

Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
```

* When `a` is created by calling `new Foo()`, one of the things [...] happens is that `a` gets an internal `[[Prototype]]` link to the object that `Foo.prototype` is pointing at.

* That's it. We didn't instantiate a class. We [...] didn't do any `copying of behavior` from a "class" into a [...] object [...] `new Foo()` is an `indirect` [...] way to end up with what we want: **a new object linked to another object** [...] a `more direct` way? [...] is `Object.create(..)`.

#### What's in a name?
* I believe the label "`prototypal inheritance`" itself (and trying to `mis-apply` all its associated class-orientation terminology, like "class", "constructor", "instance", "polymorphism", etc) has done **more harm than good** in explaining how JavaScript's mechanism *really* works.

* "Inheritance" implies a *copy* [...] JavaScript doesn't copy object properties (`natively, by default`). Instead, JS creates a link between two objects, where one object can essentially *delegate* property/function access to another object. "`Delegation`" (see Chapter 6) is a `much more accurate` term for JavaScript's `object-linking mechanism`.
### "Constructors"
```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo; // true

var a = new Foo();
a.constructor === Foo; // true
```

* The `Foo.prototype` object `by default` (at `declaration time` on line 1 of the snippet!) gets a `public`, `non-enumerable` [...] property called `.constructor`, and this property is a reference back to the `function` (`Foo` in this case) that the object is associated with.

* object `a` [...] `seems` to also have a property on it called `.constructor` which similarly points to "`the function which created it`" [...] This is `not actually true`. `a` has no `.constructor` property `on it`, and though `a.constructor` does in fact resolve to the `Foo` function, "`constructor`" **does not actually mean** "`was constructed by`" [...] We'll explain this strangeness shortly.

#### Constructor Or Call?
* a "`constructor`" is **any function called with the `new` keyword** in front of it [...] Functions aren't constructors, `but` `function calls` are (me: called) "`constructor calls`" if and only if `new` is used.

### Mechanics
* (me: revise) At the beginning of this chapter, we explained the `[[Prototype]]` link, and how it provides the `fall-back look-up` steps `if` a property reference `isn't found` `directly` on an object, as part of the `default` `[[Get]]` algorithm.

#### "Constructor" Redux
* There are actually several ways that the `ill-fated assumption` of `.constructor` meaning "`was constructed by`" can come back to bite you.

Consider:

```js
function Foo() { /* .. */ }

Foo.prototype = { /* .. */ }; // create a new prototype object

var a1 = new Foo();
a1.constructor === Foo; // false!
a1.constructor === Object; // true!
```

* It [...] `seems like` `Foo()` "constructed" (me: `a1`) [...] `but` where everything falls apart is when you think "`constructor`" means "`was constructed by`".

* What's happening? `a1` has no `.constructor` property, so it delegates up the `[[Prototype]]` chain to `Foo.prototype`. `But` that object `doesn't` have a `.constructor` either (like the `default` `Foo.prototype` object would have had!), so it `keeps delegating`, this time up to `Object.prototype`, the `top of the delegation chain`. *That* object indeed has a `.constructor` on it, which points to the built-in `Object(..)` function.

* The best thing to do is remind yourself, "`constructor does not mean constructed by`".

* `.constructor` is [...] *is* non-enumerable [...] but its value is writable (can be changed), and moreover, you can add or overwrite (intentionally or accidentally) a property of the name `constructor` on any object in any `[[Prototype]]` chain, with any value you see fit [...] `.constructor` is `extremely unreliable` [...] **such references should be avoided where possible.**

## "(Prototypal) Inheritance"
```js
function Foo(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Foo.prototype.myName = function() {
	return this.name;
};

function Bar(name,label) {
	Foo.call( this, name );
	this.label = label;
}

// here, we make a new `Bar.prototype`
// linked to `Foo.prototype`
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// Beware! Now `Bar.prototype.constructor` is gone,
// and might need to be manually "fixed" if you're
// in the habit of relying on such properties!

Bar.prototype.myLabel = function() {
	return this.label;
};

var a = new Bar( "a", "obj a" );

a.myName(); // "a"
a.myLabel(); // "obj a"
```

* The important part is `Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype )`. `Object.create(..)` *creates* a "new" object [...] and links that new object's internal `[[Prototype]]` to the object you specify (`Foo.prototype` in this case).

* When `function Bar() { .. }` is declared [...] (me: it) has a `.prototype` link to `its default object`. But *that* object `is not` linked to `Foo.prototype` like we want. So, we create a *new* object that *is* linked as we want, effectively throwing away the original incorrectly-linked object.

* A common mis-conception/confusion here is that `either` of the following approaches would `also work`, `but` they do `not work as you'd expect`:

```js
// doesn't work like you want!
Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype;

// works kinda like you want, but with
// side-effects you probably don't want :(
Bar.prototype = new Foo();
```

* `Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype` [...] just makes `Bar.prototype` [...] (me: a `direct`) reference to `Foo.prototype` [...] This means when you start `assigning`, like `Bar.prototype.myLabel = ...`, you're modifying [...] `Foo.prototype` object itself, which would `affect` any `objects` `linked to` `Foo.prototype`.

* `Bar.prototype = new Foo()` **does in fact** create a new object [...] linked to `Foo.prototype` as we'd want [...] uses the `Foo(..)` "`constructor call`" [...] If that function has any `side-effects` (such as `logging`, `changing state` [...] etc.), those side-effects happen at the time of this linking [...] `rather than` `only when` the eventual `Bar()` (me: `instances`)("descendants") are created.

* It would be *nice* if there was a standard and reliable way to modify the linkage of an existing object. `Prior to ES6`, there's a `non-standard` and `not fully-cross-browser` way, via the `.__proto__` property, which is `settable`. ES6 adds a `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)` helper utility, which does the trick in a standard and predictable way.

* Compare the pre-ES6 and ES6-`standardized` techniques for linking `Bar.prototype` to `Foo.prototype`, side-by-side:

```js
// pre-ES6
// throws away default existing `Bar.prototype`
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// ES6+
// modifies existing `Bar.prototype`
Object.setPrototypeOf( Bar.prototype, Foo.prototype );
```

### Inspecting "Class" Relationships
* `Inspecting` an instance [...] for its `inheritance ancestry` (`delegation linkage` in JS) is often called *introspection* (or *reflection*) in [...] class-oriented environments.
`inheritance ancestry` 
```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

Foo.prototype.blah = ...;

var a = new Foo();
```

* How do we then introspect `a` [...] The `first approach`.

```js
a instanceof Foo; // true
```

* The question `instanceof` answers is: **in the entire `[[Prototype]]` chain of `a`, `does` (me: `the` in the word `the object` `does not` refer to any of the `S`s (in English grammar) mentioned earlier in this argument, it is there before the word `object` ony because the word `object` is used inside a `passive clause`. Technically, the word `the object` here refers to an object in side the `[[prototype]]` chain which is being processed by the `instanceof` operator)(the object) arbitrarily pointed to by `Foo.prototype` `ever appear`?**

* Unfortunately, this means that you can `only` inquire about the "ancestry" of some object [...] if you have some **function** [...] with its attached `.prototype` reference (me: read the above argument to gain a better understanding of how the `instanceof` work and why the `.prototype` reference is emphasized here) [...] to test with. If you have two [...] objects, say `a` and `b`, and want to find out if *the objects* are related to each other through a `[[Prototype]]` chain, `instanceof` alone can't help.

* If you use the [...] `.bind(..)` [...] to make a hard-bound function [...] the function created `will not have` a `.prototype` property. Using `instanceof` with such a function `transparently` `substitutes` the `.prototype` of the *target function* that the hard-bound function `was created from`.

* This snippet illustrates the [...] trying to reason about relationships between **two objects** using [...] `instanceof`:

```js
// helper utility to see if `o1` is
// related to (delegates to) `o2`
function isRelatedTo(o1, o2) {
	function F(){}
	F.prototype = o2;
	return o1 instanceof F;
}

var a = {};
var b = Object.create( a );

isRelatedTo( b, a ); // true
```

* Inside `isRelatedTo(..)`, we borrow a `throw-away` function `F`, reassign its `.prototype` to arbitrarily point to some object `o2`, then ask if `o1` is an "instance of" `F` (me: revise the third argument of this section for a better understand of how `instanceof` works). Obviously `o1` isn't *actually* inherited or descended or even constructed from `F`, so it should be clear why this kind of exercise is [...] confusing. **The problem comes down to the `awkwardness` of class semantics `forced upon` JavaScript**

* The [...] much cleaner [...] approach.

```js
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf( a ); // true
```

* we don't really care about [...] `Foo`, we just need an **object** (in our case [...] `Foo.prototype`) to test against another **object**. The question `isPrototypeOf(..)` answers is: **in the entire `[[Prototype]]` chain of `a`, does `Foo.prototype` ever appear?**

* our `isRelatedTo(..)` utility above is built-in to the language, and it's called `isPrototypeOf(..)`.

* `directly` retrieve the `[[Prototype]]` of an object. As of ES5, the standard way to do this is:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf( a );
```

* And you'll notice that object reference is what we'd expect:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
```

* `Most` browsers (`not all`!) have also long supported a `non-standard alternate` way of accessing the internal `[[Prototype]]`:

```js
a.__proto__ === Foo.prototype; // true
```

* `.__proto__` (`not standardized` `until ES6`!) property [...] retrieves the internal `[[Prototype]]` of an object as a reference, which is quite helpful if you want to directly inspect (or even traverse: `.__proto__.__proto__...`) the chain.

* `.__proto__` doesn't actually exist on the object you're inspecting [...] In fact, it exists (`non-enumerable` [...]) on the built-in `Object.prototype`.

* `.__proto__` is also a `settable` property [...] However, generally you **should not change the `[[Prototype]]` of an existing object**.

## Object Links
* As we've now seen, the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism is an internal link that exists on one object which references some other object.

### `Create()`ing Links
```js
var foo = {
	something: function() {
		console.log( "Tell me something good..." );
	}
};

var bar = Object.create( foo );

bar.something(); // Tell me something good...
```

* `Object.create(..)` creates a new object (`bar`) linked to the object we specified (`foo`), which gives us all the power (`delegation`) of the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism, but `without` any of the unnecessary complication of `new` functions `acting as` classes and `constructor calls` [...]  or any of that extra stuff.

* `Object.create(null)` creates an object that has an `empty` (aka, `null`) `[[Prototype]]` `linkage` [...] thus the object `can't delegate anywhere`. Since such an object `has no prototype chain`, the `instanceof` operator (`explained earlier`) `has nothing to check`, so it will always return `false`. These special empty-`[[Prototype]]` objects are often called "`dictionaries`" as they are typically used `purely` for `storing data` in properties, mostly because they have `no possible surprise effects` from any `delegated properties/functions` on the `[[Prototype]]` chain.

#### `Object.create()` Polyfilled
### Links As Fallbacks?
* It may be tempting to think that these links between objects *primarily* provide a sort of `fallback` for `"missing" properties or methods`. While that may be an `observed outcome`, I `don't think` it represents the `right way` of thinking about `[[Prototype]]`.

```js
var anotherObject = {
	cool: function() {
		console.log( "cool!" );
	}
};

var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

myObject.cool(); // "cool!"
```

* That code will work `by virtue of` `[[Prototype]]`, but if you wrote it that way so that `anotherObject` was acting as a fallback **just in case** `myObject` couldn't handle some property/method [...] `odds are that` your software is going to be a bit more "`magical`" and harder to understand and maintain.

* In `ES6`, an `advanced functionality` called `Proxy` is introduced which can provide something of a "`method not found`" type of behavior.

* You can however design your API with `less "magic"` [...] but still take advantage of the power of `[[Prototype]]` linkage.

```js
var anotherObject = {
	cool: function() {
		console.log( "cool!" );
	}
};

var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

myObject.doCool = function() {
	this.cool(); // internal delegation!
};

myObject.doCool(); // "cool!"
```

* `delegation` will tend to be `less surprising/confusing` [...] We will expound on **delegation** in great detail in the next chapter.

## Review (TL;DR)

# Chapter 6: Behavior Delegation
## Towards Delegation-Oriented Design
### Class Theory
* Let's say we have several similar tasks ("XYZ", "ABC", etc) [...] in our software [...] With classes, the way you design the scenario is: define a general parent (base) class like `Task`, defining shared behavior for all the "alike" tasks. Then, you define child classes `XYZ` and `ABC`, both of which inherit from `Task`, and each of which adds specialized behavior to handle their respective tasks.

```js
class Task {
	id;

	// constructor `Task()`
	Task(ID) { id = ID; }
	outputTask() { output( id ); }
}

class XYZ inherits Task {
	label;

	// constructor `XYZ()`
	XYZ(ID,Label) { super( ID ); label = Label; }
	outputTask() { super(); output( label ); }
}

class ABC inherits Task {
	// ...
}
```

### Delegation Theory
* let's try to think about the `same problem` [...] using *behavior delegation* instead of *classes*.

* You will first define an **object** (`not a class`, `nor a function` [...]) called `Task`, and it will have concrete behavior on it that includes utility methods that various tasks can use (read: *delegate to*!). Then, for each task ("XYZ", "ABC"), you define an **object** to hold that task-specific data/behavior. You **link** your task-specific object(s) to the `Task` utility object, allowing them to `delegate to` it when they need to.

```js
var Task = {
	setID: function(ID) { this.id = ID; },
	outputID: function() { console.log( this.id ); }
};

// make `XYZ` delegate to `Task`
var XYZ = Object.create( Task );

XYZ.prepareTask = function(ID,Label) {
	this.setID( ID );
	this.label = Label;
};

XYZ.outputTaskDetails = function() {
	this.outputID();
	console.log( this.label );
};

// ABC = Object.create( Task );
// ABC ... = ...
```

* `Task` and `XYZ` are not classes (or functions), they're **just objects**. `XYZ` is set up via `Object.create(..)` to `[[Prototype]]` `delegate to` the `Task` object.

* As compared to class-orientation (aka, OO -- object-oriented), I call this style of code **"OLOO"** (objects-linked-to-other-objects). All we *really* care about is that the `XYZ` object delegates to the `Task` object (as does the `ABC` object).

* Some other differences to note with **OLOO style code**:
  1. Both `id` and `label` data members from the [...] example are data properties `directly` on `XYZ` (`neither` is on `Task`). In general, with `[[Prototype]]` delegation involved, **you want state to be on the `delegators`** (`XYZ`, `ABC`), not on the `delegate` (`Task`).
 
  2. With the `class design pattern`, we `intentionally` named `outputTask` the same on both parent (`Task`) and child (`XYZ`), so that we could take advantage of `overriding (polymorphism)`. In `behavior delegation` [...] **we avoid if at all possible naming things the same** at different levels of the `[[Prototype]]` chain (called `shadowing` [...]), because having those name `collisions` creates awkward/brittle syntax to `disambiguate` references (see `Chapter 4`).

  3. `this.setID(ID);` inside of a method on the `XYZ` object first looks on `XYZ` for `setID(..)`, but since it `doesn't find` a method of that name on `XYZ`, `[[Prototype]]` *delegation* means it can follow the link to `Task` to look for `setID(..)`, which it of course finds. `Moreover`, because of `implicit call-site` `this` `binding rules` (see `Chapter 2`), when `setID(..)` runs [...] the `this` binding for that function call is `XYZ`.

* **Behavior Delegation** means: let some object (`XYZ`) provide a delegation (to `Task`) for property or method references if not found on the object (`XYZ`).

* This [...] (me: `Delegation`)(design pattern) [...] Rather than organizing the objects in your mind `vertically`, with Parents flowing down to Children, think of objects `side-by-side` [...] with [...] direction of delegation links between the objects as necessary.

#### Mutual Delegation (Disallowed)
* You `cannot` create a *cycle* where `two or more` objects are `mutually delegated` (bi-directionally) to each other. If you make `B` linked to `A`, and then try to link `A` to `B`, you will get an error.

* If you made a reference to a property/method which didn't exist in `either` place, you'd have an `infinite recursion` on the `[[Prototype]]` loop.

#### Debugged
* Consider this traditional "class constructor" style JS code, as it would appear in the *console* of `Chrome Developer Tools`:

```js
function Foo() {}

var a1 = new Foo();

a1; // Foo {}
```

* the last line of that snippet: the output of evaluating the `a1` expression, which prints `Foo {}`. If you try this same code in Firefox, you will likely see `Object {}`. Why the difference? What do these outputs mean?

* Chrome is [...] saying "{} is an empty object [...] constructed by a function with name 'Foo'". Firefox is saying "{} is an empty object of general construction from Object".

* is [...] Chrome [...] outputting "Foo", by simply examining the object's `.constructor.name`? [...] the answer is both "yes" and "no".

```js
function Foo() {}

var a1 = new Foo();

Foo.prototype.constructor = function Gotcha(){};

a1.constructor; // Gotcha(){}
a1.constructor.name; // "Gotcha"

a1; // Foo {}
```

* Even though we change `a1.constructor.name` to [...] something else ("Gotcha"), Chrome's console still uses the "Foo" name [...] So, it `would appear` the answer to previous question (does it use `.constructor.name`?) is **no** [...] But:

```js
var Foo = {};

var a1 = Object.create( Foo );

a1; // Object {}

Object.defineProperty( Foo, "constructor", {
	enumerable: false,
	value: function Gotcha(){}
});

a1; // Gotcha {}
```

* Ah-ha! **Gotcha!** Here, Chrome's console **did** find and use the `.constructor.name`. Actually [...] this exact behavior `was` identified as a bug in Chrome, and `by the time` you're reading this, it `may` have already been fixed. So you `may` instead have seen `the corrected` `a1; // Object {}`.

* Aside from that bug, the `internal tracking` (apparently `only` `for debug output purposes`) of the "`constructor name`" that Chrome does (shown in the `earlier snippets`) is an `intentional` `Chrome-only` `extension of behavior` `beyond` what the `JS specification` calls for.

* If you don't use a "`constructor`" to `make your objects` [...] you'll get objects that `Chrome` `does not` track an `internal "constructor name"` for, and such objects will `correctly` only be outputted as "`Object {}`", meaning "`object generated from Object() construction`".

* this represents a `drawback` of OLOO-style coding. When you code with OLOO and `behavior delegation` as your `design pattern`, *who* "constructed" (that is, *which function* was called with `new`?) some object is an `irrelevant` detail. `Chrome's specific internal "constructor name" tracking` is really `only` useful if you're `fully embracing` "`class-style`" coding.

### Mental Models Compared
* We'll examine some more theoretical [...] code, and compare [...] OO vs. OLOO [...] The first snippet uses the classical ("prototypal") OO style:

```js
function Foo(who) {
	this.me = who;
}
Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
	return "I am " + this.me;
};

function Bar(who) {
	Foo.call( this, who );
}
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

Bar.prototype.speak = function() {
	alert( "Hello, " + this.identify() + "." );
};

var b1 = new Bar( "b1" );
var b2 = new Bar( "b2" );

b1.speak();
b2.speak();
```

* let's implement **the exact same functionality** using *OLOO* style code:

```js
var Foo = {
	init: function(who) {
		this.me = who;
	},
	identify: function() {
		return "I am " + this.me;
	}
};

var Bar = Object.create( Foo );

Bar.speak = function() {
	alert( "Hello, " + this.identify() + "." );
};

var b1 = Object.create( Bar );
b1.init( "b1" );
var b2 = Object.create( Bar );
b2.init( "b2" );

b1.speak();
b2.speak();
```

* now we just set up **objects** linked to each other, without needing [...] things that look (but don't behave!) like classes, with constructors and prototypes and `new` calls.

* (WCRL)(Ask yourself: if I can get the same functionality with OLOO style code as I do with "class" style code, but OLOO is simpler and has less things to think about, **isn't OLOO better**?)

## Classes vs. Objects
* We'll first examine a typical scenario in `front-end web dev`: creating UI widgets (buttons, drop-downs, etc).

### Widget "Classes"
* Because you're probably still `so used to` the OO design pattern, you'll likely immediately think of this problem domain in terms of a parent class (perhaps called `Widget`) with all the `common` base widget behavior, and then child derived classes for specific widget types (like `Button`).

* We're going to use `jQuery` here for DOM and CSS manipulation [...] None of this code cares which JS framework [...] you might solve such mundane tasks with.

```js
// Parent class
function Widget(width,height) {
	this.width = width || 50;
	this.height = height || 50;
	this.$elem = null;
}

Widget.prototype.render = function($where){
	if (this.$elem) {
		this.$elem.css( {
			width: this.width + "px",
			height: this.height + "px"
		} ).appendTo( $where );
	}
};

// Child class
function Button(width,height,label) {
	// "super" constructor call
	Widget.call( this, width, height );
	this.label = label || "Default";

	this.$elem = $( "<button>" ).text( this.label );
}

// make `Button` "inherit" from `Widget`
Button.prototype = Object.create( Widget.prototype );

// override base "inherited" `render(..)`
Button.prototype.render = function($where) {
	// "super" call
	Widget.prototype.render.call( this, $where );
	this.$elem.click( this.onClick.bind( this ) );
};

Button.prototype.onClick = function(evt) {
	console.log( "Button '" + this.label + "' clicked!" );
};

$( document ).ready( function(){
	var $body = $( document.body );
	var btn1 = new Button( 125, 30, "Hello" );
	var btn2 = new Button( 150, 40, "World" );

	btn1.render( $body );
	btn2.render( $body );
} );
```

* Notice the `ugliness` of *explicit pseudo-polymorphism* (see Chapter 4) with `Widget.call` and `Widget.prototype.render.call` references for `faking` "super" calls.

#### ES6 `class` sugar
* We cover ES6 `class` syntax sugar in detail in `Appendix A`, but let's briefly demonstrate how we'd implement the same code using `class`:

```js
class Widget {
	constructor(width,height) {
		this.width = width || 50;
		this.height = height || 50;
		this.$elem = null;
	}
	render($where){
		if (this.$elem) {
			this.$elem.css( {
				width: this.width + "px",
				height: this.height + "px"
			} ).appendTo( $where );
		}
	}
}

class Button extends Widget {
	constructor(width,height,label) {
		super( width, height );
		this.label = label || "Default";
		this.$elem = $( "<button>" ).text( this.label );
	}
	render($where) {
		super.render( $where );
		this.$elem.click( this.onClick.bind( this ) );
	}
	onClick(evt) {
		console.log( "Button '" + this.label + "' clicked!" );
	}
}

$( document ).ready( function(){
	var $body = $( document.body );
	var btn1 = new Button( 125, 30, "Hello" );
	var btn2 = new Button( 150, 40, "World" );

	btn1.render( $body );
	btn2.render( $body );
} );
```

* a number of the syntax uglies of the previous classical approach have been smoothed over with ES6's `class`.

* **these are not *real* classes**, as they still operate on top of the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism [...] Appendix A will expound on the ES6 `class` syntax and its implications in detail. We'll see why solving syntax hiccups doesn't substantially solve our class confusions in JS.

### Delegating Widget Objects
* Here's our simpler `Widget` / `Button` example, using **OLOO style delegation**:

```js
var Widget = {
	init: function(width,height){
		this.width = width || 50;
		this.height = height || 50;
		this.$elem = null;
	},
	insert: function($where){
		if (this.$elem) {
			this.$elem.css( {
				width: this.width + "px",
				height: this.height + "px"
			} ).appendTo( $where );
		}
	}
};

var Button = Object.create( Widget );

Button.setup = function(width,height,label){
	// delegated call
	this.init( width, height );
	this.label = label || "Default";

	this.$elem = $( "<button>" ).text( this.label );
};
Button.build = function($where) {
	// delegated call
	this.insert( $where );
	this.$elem.click( this.onClick.bind( this ) );
};
Button.onClick = function(evt) {
	console.log( "Button '" + this.label + "' clicked!" );
};

$( document ).ready( function(){
	var $body = $( document.body );

	var btn1 = Object.create( Button );
	btn1.setup( 125, 30, "Hello" );

	var btn2 = Object.create( Button );
	btn2.setup( 150, 40, "World" );

	btn1.build( $body );
	btn2.build( $body );
} );
```

* With this OLOO-style approach, we don't think of `Widget` as a parent and `Button` as a child. Rather, `Widget` **is just an object** [...] a utility collection that any specific type of widget might want to `delegate to`, and `Button` **is also just a stand-alone object** (with a delegation link to `Widget`).

* we chose different names (`insert(..)` and `build(..)`) that were more descriptive of what task each does specifically. The *initialization* methods are called `init(..)` and `setup(..)`, respectively, for the same reasons [...] (me: by) doing so [...] OLOO happens to avoid the ugliness of the explicit `pseudo-polymorphic calls` (`Widget.call` and `Widget.prototype.render.call`) [...] (me: instead uses) delegated calls to `this.init(..)` and `this.insert(..)` (me: duplicating `delegatable function`'s name is OK. However, since the `delegatable function`'s name is duplicated with `its caller function`'s name, we can not delegate to the `delegatable function` by simply calling `this.delegatableFunction`, but will have to instead use `pseudo-polymorphic calls`).

## Simpler Design
* The scenario we'll examine is two `controller objects`, one for handling the login form of a web page, and another for actually handling the authentication (communication) with the server [...] We'll need a `utility helper` for `making the Ajax communication`.

* We don't cover Promises here.

* Following the typical class design pattern.

```js
// Parent class
function Controller() {
	this.errors = [];
}
Controller.prototype.showDialog = function(title,msg) {
	// display title & message to user in dialog
};
Controller.prototype.success = function(msg) {
	this.showDialog( "Success", msg );
};
Controller.prototype.failure = function(err) {
	this.errors.push( err );
	this.showDialog( "Error", err );
};
```

```js
// Child class
function LoginController() {
	Controller.call( this );
}
// Link child class to parent
LoginController.prototype = Object.create( Controller.prototype );
LoginController.prototype.getUser = function() {
	return document.getElementById( "login_username" ).value;
};
LoginController.prototype.getPassword = function() {
	return document.getElementById( "login_password" ).value;
};
LoginController.prototype.validateEntry = function(user,pw) {
	user = user || this.getUser();
	pw = pw || this.getPassword();

	if (!(user && pw)) {
		return this.failure( "Please enter a username & password!" );
	}
	else if (pw.length < 5) {
		return this.failure( "Password must be 5+ characters!" );
	}

	// got here? validated!
	return true;
};
// Override to extend base `failure()`
LoginController.prototype.failure = function(err) {
	// "super" call
	Controller.prototype.failure.call( this, "Login invalid: " + err );
};
```

```js
// Child class
function AuthController(login) {
	Controller.call( this );
	// in addition to inheritance, we also need composition
	this.login = login;
}
// Link child class to parent
AuthController.prototype = Object.create( Controller.prototype );
AuthController.prototype.server = function(url,data) {
	return $.ajax( {
		url: url,
		data: data
	} );
};
AuthController.prototype.checkAuth = function() {
	var user = this.login.getUser();
	var pw = this.login.getPassword();

	if (this.login.validateEntry( user, pw )) {
		this.server( "/check-auth",{
			user: user,
			pw: pw
		} )
		.then( this.success.bind( this ) )
		.fail( this.failure.bind( this ) );
	}
};
// Override to extend base `success()`
AuthController.prototype.success = function() {
	// "super" call
	Controller.prototype.success.call( this, "Authenticated!" );
};
// Override to extend base `failure()`
AuthController.prototype.failure = function(err) {
	// "super" call
	Controller.prototype.failure.call( this, "Auth Failed: " + err );
};
```

```js
var auth = new AuthController(
	// in addition to inheritance, we also need composition
	new LoginController()
);
auth.checkAuth();
```

* note that `AuthController` needs an instance of `LoginController` to interact with the login form, so that becomes a member data property.

* There *might* have been a [...] temptation to make `AuthController` inherit from `LoginController`, or vice versa [...] But this is a strongly clear example of what's wrong with class inheritance as *the* model for the problem domain, because neither `AuthController` nor `LoginController` are specializing base behavior of the other, so inheritance between them makes little sense except if classes are your only design pattern.

### De-class-ified
* OLOO-style behavior delegation:

```js
var LoginController = {
	errors: [],
	getUser: function() {
		return document.getElementById( "login_username" ).value;
	},
	getPassword: function() {
		return document.getElementById( "login_password" ).value;
	},
	validateEntry: function(user,pw) {
		user = user || this.getUser();
		pw = pw || this.getPassword();

		if (!(user && pw)) {
			return this.failure( "Please enter a username & password!" );
		}
		else if (pw.length < 5) {
			return this.failure( "Password must be 5+ characters!" );
		}

		// got here? validated!
		return true;
	},
	showDialog: function(title,msg) {
		// display success message to user in dialog
	},
	failure: function(err) {
		this.errors.push( err );
		this.showDialog( "Error", "Login invalid: " + err );
	}
};
```

```js
// Link `AuthController` to delegate to `LoginController`
var AuthController = Object.create( LoginController );

AuthController.errors = [];
AuthController.checkAuth = function() {
	var user = this.getUser();
	var pw = this.getPassword();

	if (this.validateEntry( user, pw )) {
		this.server( "/check-auth",{
			user: user,
			pw: pw
		} )
		.then( this.accepted.bind( this ) )
		.fail( this.rejected.bind( this ) );
	}
};
AuthController.server = function(url,data) {
	return $.ajax( {
		url: url,
		data: data
	} );
};
AuthController.accepted = function() {
	this.showDialog( "Success", "Authenticated!" )
};
AuthController.rejected = function(err) {
	this.failure( "Auth Failed: " + err );
};
```

* to perform our task. All we need to do is:

```js
AuthController.checkAuth();
```

* We somewhat arbitrarily chose to have `AuthController` delegate to `LoginController` -- it [...] (me: could) have been [...] (me: in) the reverse direction.

* We didn't need a base `Controller` class to "share" behavior between the two, because delegation [...] give us the functionality we need. We also [...] don't need to instantiate our classes to work with them [...] there's no need for *composition* as delegation gives the two objects the ability to cooperate *differentially* as needed [...] we avoided the `polymorphism pitfalls` of class-oriented design by not having the names `success(..)` and `failure(..)` be the same on both objects.

## Nicer Syntax
* ES6's `class` so [...] attractive (see `Appendix A` on `why to avoid it`!) is the short-hand syntax for declaring class methods:

```js
class Foo {
	methodName() { /* .. */ }
}
```

* We get to drop the word `function` from the declaration, which makes JS developers everywhere cheer!

* As of ES6, we can use *concise method declarations* in any object literal, so an object in `OLOO` style can be declared this way.

```js
var LoginController = {
	errors: [],
	getUser() { // Look ma, no `function`!
		// ...
	},
	getPassword() {
		// ...
	}
	// ...
};
```

* Moreover, as of `ES6` [...] you can just modify that object's `[[Prototype]]` with `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)`.

```js
// use nicer object literal syntax w/ concise methods!
var AuthController = {
	errors: [],
	checkAuth() {
		// ...
	},
	server(url,data) {
		// ...
	}
	// ...
};

// NOW, link `AuthController` to delegate to `LoginController`
Object.setPrototypeOf( AuthController, LoginController );
```

### Unlexical
## Introspection
* If you've spent much time with class oriented programming [...] you're probably familiar with *type introspection*: inspecting an instance to find out [...] *how it was created*.

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}
Foo.prototype.something = function(){
	// ...
}

var a1 = new Foo();

// later

if (a1 instanceof Foo) {
	a1.something();
}
```

* `instanceof` (me: seems to inspect) [...] the relationship between `a1` and `Foo`, but it's actually telling us whether `a1` [...] `Foo.prototype` (me: see `Chapter 5`) are related [...] (me: which leads to `semantic confusion`).

* Using this OLOO approach, where all we have are plain objects that are related via `[[Prototype]]` delegation, here's the quite simplified *type introspection* we might use:

```js
// relating `Foo` and `Bar` to each other
Foo.isPrototypeOf( Bar ); // true
Object.getPrototypeOf( Bar ) === Foo; // true

// relating `b1` to both `Foo` and `Bar`
Foo.isPrototypeOf( b1 ); // true
Bar.isPrototypeOf( b1 ); // true
Object.getPrototypeOf( b1 ) === Bar; // true
```

* We're not using `instanceof` anymore, because it's `confusingly` pretending to have something to do with classes. Now, we just ask [...] "are you *a* prototype of me?".

## Review (TL;DR)

# Appendix A: ES6 `class`
## `class`
* `class` mechanism. We'll demonstrate here how it works.

```js
class Widget {
	constructor(width,height) {
		this.width = width || 50;
		this.height = height || 50;
		this.$elem = null;
	}
	render($where){
		if (this.$elem) {
			this.$elem.css( {
				width: this.width + "px",
				height: this.height + "px"
			} ).appendTo( $where );
		}
	}
}

class Button extends Widget {
	constructor(width,height,label) {
		super( width, height );
		this.label = label || "Default";
		this.$elem = $( "<button>" ).text( this.label );
	}
	render($where) {
		super.render( $where );
		this.$elem.click( this.onClick.bind( this ) );
	}
	onClick(evt) {
		console.log( "Button '" + this.label + "' clicked!" );
	}
}
```

* Beyond this syntax *looking* nicer, `what problems` does ES6 solve?
	1. There's no more [...] references to `.prototype`.
	2. `Button` [...] `extends` [...] `Widget`, instead of needing to use `Object.create(..)` to replace a `.prototype` object that's linked, or having to set with `.__proto__` or `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)`.
	3. `super(..)` now gives us a very helpful **relative polymorphism** capability.
	4. `class` syntax is protecting you from mistakes (me: that it's state could be `implicitly` "shared" among all "instances)"
	5. `extends` lets you extend even `built-in object` [...] like `Array` or `RegExp`, in a very natural way. Doing so `without` `class .. extends` has long been an [...] complex [...] task.

## `class` Gotchas
* though. There are still some deep [...] troubling issues with using "classes" as a design pattern in JS.

* Firstly, the `class` syntax may convince you a new "class" mechanism `exists` in JS as of `ES6`. **Not so.** `class` is [...] just `syntactic sugar` on top of the existing `[[Prototype]]` (delegation!) mechanism.

* That means `class` is `not` actually copying definitions [...] at declaration time the way it does in [...] class-oriented languages. If you change/replace a method (on purpose or by accident) on the parent "class", the `child "class"` and/or `instances` will still be "affected" [...] they are all still using the `live-delegation` model based on `[[Prototype]]`:

```js
class C {
	constructor() {
		this.num = Math.random();
	}

	// (CKL: Note: `methods` `not` declared inside the constructor method are indeed declared inside the prototype property of the class `C`)
	rand() {
		console.log( "Random: " + this.num );
	}
}

var c1 = new C();
c1.rand(); // "Random: 0.4324299..."

C.prototype.rand = function() {
	console.log( "Random: " + Math.round( this.num * 1000 ));
};

var c2 = new C();
c2.rand(); // "Random: 867"

c1.rand(); // "Random: 432" -- oops!!!
```

* why are you choosing `class` syntax for something `fundamentally` different from classes? Doesn't the ES6 `class` syntax **just make it harder** to see and understand the difference between traditional classes and delegated objects?

* (me: secondly) if you need to do that to track shared state among instances, then you end up going back to the ugly `.prototype` syntax, like this:

```js
class C {
	constructor() {
		// make sure to modify the shared state,
		// not set a shadowed property on the
		// instances!
		C.prototype.count++;

		// here, `this.count` works as expected
		// via delegation
		console.log( "Hello: " + this.count );
	}
}

// add a property for shared state directly to
// prototype object
C.prototype.count = 0;

var c1 = new C();
// Hello: 1

var c2 = new C();
// Hello: 2

c1.count === 2; // true
c1.count === c2.count; // true
```

* `this.count++` (me: `if` there is one) would `implicitly` create a separate shadowed `.count` property on both `c1` and `c2` objects, `rather than` updating `the` `shared state`. 

* Moreover, `accidental shadowing` is still a hazard:

```js
class C {
	constructor(id) {
		// oops, gotcha, we're shadowing `id()` method
		// with a property value on the instance
		this.id = id;
	}
	id() {
		console.log( "Id: " + this.id );
	}
}

var c1 = new C( "c1" );
c1.id(); // TypeError -- `c1.id` is now the string "c1"
```

* There's also some very subtle nuanced issues [...] is that `super` would `always` be bound to `one level higher` than whatever the current method's position in the `[[Prototype]]` chain is.

* (WCRL|me)(for some reason, examples skipped below are inexecutable).

## Static > Dynamic?
* But the `biggest problem` of all about ES6 `class` is that [...] `class` sorta opts you into a syntax which seems to imply [...] that once you declare a `class`, it's a static `definition` of a [...] thing. You completely `lose sight` of the fact that `C` is an object [...] which you can directly interact with.

## Review (TL;DR)

# Appendix B: Thank You's!
