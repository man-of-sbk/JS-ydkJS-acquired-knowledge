# Foreword
# Preface
# Chapter 1: Types
* `ES5.1 specification` ([http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/)) [...] say.
> values [...] has an associated type [...] The `ECMAScript language types` are `Undefined`, `Null`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, and `Object`.

* a *type* is an [...] built-in `set of characteristics` [...] (me: identifying) the `behavior` of a [...] value and `distinguishes` it from other values, both to the engine **and to the developer**.

## A Type By Any Other Name...
* `Coercion` confusion is perhaps one of the most [...] frustrations for JavaScript developers [...] often been criticized as [...] a flaw in the design of the language.

## Built-in Types
* `seven` built-in types:

* `null`
* `undefined`
* `boolean`
* `number`
* `string`
* `object`
* `symbol` -- added in ES6!

* All of these types `except` `object` are called "`primitives`".

* The `typeof` operator inspects the type of the given value [...] surprisingly, there's `not` an `exact 1-to-1 match` with the seven built-in types we just listed.

```js
typeof undefined     === "undefined"; // true
typeof true          === "boolean";   // true
typeof 42            === "number";    // true
typeof "42"          === "string";    // true
typeof { life: 42 }  === "object";    // true

// (me)
typeof [] === 'object' // true

// added in ES6!
typeof Symbol()      === "symbol";    // true
```

* As you may have noticed, I excluded `null` from the above listing. It's *special* [...] in the sense that it's buggy `when combined` with the `typeof` operator:

```js
typeof null === "object"; // true
```

* this `original bug` in JS has persisted for nearly two decades, and will likely never be fixed because there's too much existing web content that relies on its buggy behavior.

* If you want to test for a `null` value using its type, you need a compound condition:

```js
var a = null;

(!a && typeof a === "object"); // true
```

* `null` is the `only` primitive value that is "`falsy`" ([...] see Chapter 4) but [...] also returns `"object"` from the `typeof` check.

* the seventh string value that `typeof` can return.

```js
typeof function a(){ /* .. */ } === "function"; // true
```

* if you read the spec, you'll see (me: `function`)(it)'s actually a "`subtype`" of object [...] referred to as a "`callable object`" -- an object that has an internal `[[Call]]` property that allows it to be invoked.

* The function object has a `length` property set to the number of `formal parameters` it is `declared with`.

```js
a.length; // 2

// (me: my own content start here)
function a(...b) {}
a.length; // 0

function a(b, c) {}
a.length; // 2
```

* are (me: `arrays`)(they) a special type?

```js
typeof [1,2,3] === "object"; // true
```

## Values as Types
* In JavaScript, `variables` `don't have types` -- **values have types**. `Variables` can hold any value, at any time.

* Another way to think about JS types is that JS doesn't have "`type enforcement`," [...] A variable can, in one assignment statement, hold a `string`, and in the next hold a `number`.

* The *value* `42` has an [...] type of `number`, and its *type* cannot be changed [...] (me: value like) `"42"` with the `string` type, can be *created from* the `number` value `42` through a process called **coercion**.

* If you use `typeof` against a variable, it's not asking "what's the type of the `variable`?" [...] Instead, it's asking "what's the type of the `value` *in* the variable?"

### `undefined` vs "undeclared"
* Variables that have no value *currently*, actually have the `undefined` value. Calling `typeof` against such variables will return `"undefined"`:

* most developers to think of the word "`undefined`" and think of it as a `synonym` for "`undeclared`." However, in JS, these two concepts are quite different [...] An "`undefined`" variable is one that has been declared [...] but *at the moment* has no other value [...] `By contrast`, an "`undeclared`" variable is one that has `not` been `formally declared` `in the accessible scope`.

```js
var a;

a; // undefined
b; // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

* An annoying confusion is the error message [...] "b is not defined," which is of course very easy [...] to confuse with "b is undefined." [...] It'd be nice if the browsers said something like "b is not found" or "b is not declared,".

* There's also a special behavior associated with `typeof` [...] that even further reinforces the confusion.

```js
var a;

typeof a; // "undefined"

typeof b; // "undefined"
```

* The `typeof` operator returns `"undefined"` even for "`undeclared`" (or "`not defined`") variables [...] there was `no error` thrown when we executed `typeof b` [...] This is a special `safety guard` in the behavior of `typeof`.

### `typeof` Undeclared
* Nevertheless, this `safety guard` is a useful feature when dealing with JavaScript in the browser, where `multiple script files` can load variables into the `shared global namespace`.

* Many developers believe there should `never` be any variables in the `global namespace` [...] everything should be contained in `modules` and `private/separate namespaces`. This is great [...] but nearly impossible in practicality [...] Fortunately, ES6 added first-class support for `modules`, which will eventually make that much more practical.

* imagine having a "`debug mode`" in your program [...] controlled by a `global variable` [...] called `DEBUG`. You'd want to check if that variable `was declared` before performing a debug task [...] A `top-level global` `var DEBUG = true` declaration would `only be included` in a "`debug.js`" [...] `only` load into the browser when you're in development/testing, but not in production [...] However, you have to [...] check for the global `DEBUG` variable [...] so that you don't throw a `ReferenceError`.

```js
// oops, this would throw an error!
if (DEBUG) {
	console.log( "Debugging is starting" );
}

// this is a safe existence check
if (typeof DEBUG !== "undefined") {
	console.log( "Debugging is starting" );
}
```

* Another way of doing these checks against `global variables` but without the `safety guard feature` of `typeof` is to observe that all `global variables` are also properties of the `global object` [...] the `window` object.

```js
if (window.DEBUG) {
	// ..
}

if (!window.atob) {
	// ..
}
```

* referencing the `global variable` with a `window` reference is something some developers prefer to avoid, especially if your code needs to run in multiple JS environments (not just browsers, but server-side node.js, for instance), where the global object may `not always` be called `window`.

* this safety guard on `typeof` is useful even if you're `not using` global variables, though these circumstances are less common.

* Other developers would prefer a design pattern called "`dependency injection`," where instead of `doSomethingCool()` inspecting [...] for `FeatureXYZ` to be defined outside/around it, it would need to have the dependency explicitly passed in, like:

```js
function doSomethingCool(FeatureXYZ) {
	var helper = FeatureXYZ ||
		function() { /*.. default feature ..*/ };

	var val = helper();
	// ..
}
```

## Review

# Chapter 2: Values
## Arrays
* JavaScript `array`s are just containers for `any` type of value.

* You don't need to `presize` your `array`s [...] you can just declare them and add values as you see fit:

* Using `delete` on an `array` value will remove that slot from the `array`, but [...] it does **not** update the `length` property.

* Be careful about [...] leaving or creating `empty/missing` slots:

```js
var a = [ ];

a[0] = 1;
// no `a[1]` slot set here
a[2] = [ 3 ];

a[1];		// undefined

a.length;	// 3
```

* While the slot appears to have the `undefined` value in it, it `will not` `behave` the same as if the slot is explicitly set (`a[1] = undefined`). See "Arrays" in `Chapter 3`.

* `array`s are numerically indexed [...] but [...] they also are objects that can have `string` keys/properties [...] but which don't count toward the `length` (me: property).

```js
var a = [ ];

a[0] = 1;
a["foobar"] = 2;

a.length;		// 1
a["foobar"];	// 2
a.foobar;		// 2
```

* However [...] if a `string` value intended as a key can be `coerced` to a standard `base-10` `number`, then it is assumed that you [...] use it as a `number index` rather than as a `string` key!

```js
var a = [ ];

a["13"] = 42;

a.length; // 14
```

### Array-Likes
* There will be occasions where you need to convert an `array-like value` (a numerically indexed collection of values) into a true `array` [...] so you can call array utilities (like `indexOf(..)`, `concat(..)`, `forEach(..)`, etc.) against the [...] values.

* For example, various `DOM query operations` return lists of DOM elements that are not true `array`s but are `array-like` [...] Another common example is when functions expose the `arguments` (`array`-like) object (as of `ES6`, deprecated) to access the arguments as a list.

```js
function foo() {
	var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments );
	arr.push( "bam" );
	console.log( arr );
}

foo( "bar", "baz" ); // ["bar","baz","bam"]
```

* If `slice()` is called without any other parameters [...] the default values for its parameters have the effect of `duplicating` the `array` (or, in this case, `array-like`).

* As of `ES6`, there's also a built-in utility called `Array.from(..)` that can do the same task:

```js
...
var arr = Array.from( arguments );
...
```

## Strings
```js
var a = "foo";
var b = ["f","o","o"];
```

* Strings do have a `shallow resemblance` to `array`s -- `array-likes` [...] for instance, both of them having a `length` property, an `indexOf(..)` method (`array` version only as of `ES5`), and a `concat(..)` method:

* (me: strings are) just "arrays of characters", right? `Not exactly` [...] JavaScript `string`s are `immutable`, while `array`s are [...] `mutable`. Moreover, the `a[1]` character position access form was `not always widely valid` [...] `Older versions` of IE did not allow that syntax [...] Instead, the *correct* approach has been `a.charAt(1)`.

* A further consequence of `immutable` `string`s is that none of the `string` methods that alter its contents can `modify` in-place, but rather `must` create and return `new string`s. By contrast, many of the methods that change `array` contents actually *do* modify in-place.

* Also, many of the `array` methods [...] could be helpful when dealing with `string`s are not actually available for them, but we can "`borrow`" `non-mutation` `array` methods against our `string`:

```js
a.join;			// undefined
a.map;			// undefined

var c = Array.prototype.join.call( a, "-" );
var d = Array.prototype.map.call( a, function(v){
	return v.toUpperCase() + ".";
} ).join( "" );

c;				// "f-o-o"
d;				// "F.O.O."
```

* (me: the `reverse` `arrays`' method does not work with `strings`) because `string`s are `immutable` and thus can't be modified in place [...] Another [...] hack [...] is to convert the `string` into an `array`, perform the desired operation, then convert it back to a `string`.

```js
var c = a
	// split `a` into an array of characters
	.split( "" )
	// reverse the array of characters
	.reverse()
	// join the array of characters back to a string
	.join( "" );

c; // "oof"
```

* Be careful! This approach **doesn't work** for `string`s with `complex (unicode) characters` in them [...] You need more sophisticated library utilities that are `unicode-aware` for such operations to be handled accurately.

## Numbers
* JavaScript has just one numeric type: `number`. This type includes both "integer" values and fractional decimal numbers.

### Numeric Syntax
* The leading portion of a decimal value, if `0`, is optional:

```js
var a = 0.42;
var b = .42;
```

* Similarly, the trailing portion (the fractional) of a decimal value after the `.`, if `0`, is optional:

```js
var a = 42.0;
var b = 42.;
```

* By default, most `number`s will be outputted as base-10 decimals, with trailing fractional `0`s removed. So:

```js
var a = 42.300;
var b = 42.0;

a; // 42.3
b; // 42
```

* `Very large` or `very small` `number`s will by default be outputted in `exponent form`, the same as the output of the `toExponential()` method, like:

```js
var a = 5E10;
a;					// 50000000000
a.toExponential();	// "5e+10"

var b = a * a;
b;					// 2.5e+21

var c = 1 / a;
c;					// 2e-11
```

* Because `number` values can be boxed with the `Number` object wrapper [...] `number` values can access methods that are built into the `Number.prototype`.

* don't have to use a variable with the value in it to access these methods; you can access these methods directly on `number` literals. But you have to be careful with the `.` operator. Since `.` is a `valid numeric character`.

```js
// invalid syntax:
42.toFixed( 3 );	// SyntaxError

// these are all valid:
(42).toFixed( 3 );	// "42.000"
0.42.toFixed( 3 );	// "0.420"
42..toFixed( 3 );	// "42.000"
```

* `42.toFixed(3)` is invalid syntax, because the `.` is swallowed up as part of the `42.` literal.

* `42..toFixed(3)` works because the first `.` is part of the `number` and the second `.` is the `property operator`.

* This is also technically valid (notice the space):

```js
42 .toFixed(3); // "42.000"
```

* `number`s can also be specified in exponent form, which is common when representing larger `number`s, such as:

```js
var onethousand = 1E3;						// means 1 * 10^3
var onemilliononehundredthousand = 1.1E6;	// means 1.1 * 10^6
```

* `number` literals can also be expressed in other bases, like binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

```js
0xf3; // hexadecimal for: 243
0Xf3; // ditto

0363; // octal for: 243
```

* Starting with ES6 + `strict` mode, the `0363` form of octal literals is `no longer allowed` [...] The `0363` form is still allowed in non-`strict` mode, but you should stop using it anyway, to be `future-friendly` (and because you should be using `strict` mode by now!).

* As of ES6, the following new forms are also valid:

```js
0o363;		// octal for: 243
0O363;		// ditto

0b11110011;	// binary for: 243
0B11110011; // ditto
```

* Please do your fellow developers a favor: never use the `0O363` form. `0` next to capital `O` is [...] confusion. Always use the lowercase predicates `0x`, `0b`, and `0o`.

### Small Decimal Values
* The most (in)famous side effect of using binary floating-point numbers (which [...] is true of **all** languages that use `IEEE 754` -- not *just* JavaScript [...]) is:

```js
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3; // false
```

* Why is it `false`? [...] Simply put, the representations for `0.1` and `0.2` `in binary floating-point` are `not exact`, so when they are added, the result is not exactly `0.3`. It's **really** close: `0.30000000000000004`.

* The most commonly accepted practice is to use a `tiny "rounding error" value` as the *tolerance* for comparison. This `tiny value` is often called "`machine epsilon`," which is commonly `2^-52` (`2.220446049250313e-16`) for the kind of `number`s in JavaScript.

* As of `ES6`, `Number.EPSILON` is predefined with this tolerance value, so you'd want to use it, `but` you can `safely polyfill` the definition for pre-ES6:

```js
if (!Number.EPSILON) {
	Number.EPSILON = Math.pow(2,-52);
}
```

* We can use this `Number.EPSILON` to compare two `number`s for "equality" (within the rounding error tolerance):

```js
function numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(n1,n2) {
	return Math.abs( n1 - n2 ) < Number.EPSILON;
}

var a = 0.1 + 0.2;
var b = 0.3;

numbersCloseEnoughToEqual( a, b );					// true
numbersCloseEnoughToEqual( 0.0000001, 0.0000002 );	// false
```

* The maximum floating-point value that can be represented is roughly `1.798e+308` [...] predefined for you as `Number.MAX_VALUE`. On the small end, `Number.MIN_VALUE` is roughly `5e-324`.

### Safe Integer Ranges
* The `maximum integer` that can "safely" be represented (that is, there's a guarantee that the requested value is actually representable unambiguously) is `2^53 - 1`, which is `9007199254740991` [...] This value is actually automatically `predefined` in `ES6`, as `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Unsurprisingly, there's a minimum value, `-9007199254740991`, and it's defined in `ES6` as `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`.

* The main way that JS programs are confronted with dealing with such `large numbers` is when dealing with 64-bit `IDs` from `databases`, etc. `64-bit numbers` cannot be represented `accurately` with the `number` type.

* if you *do* need to perform math on these very large values [...] you'll need to use a *big number* utility. `Big numbers` may get official support in a future version of JavaScript.

### Testing for Integers
* To test if a value is an integer, you can use the ES6-specified `Number.isInteger(..)`:

```js
Number.isInteger( 42 );		// true
Number.isInteger( 42.000 );	// true
Number.isInteger( 42.3 );	// false
```

To polyfill `Number.isInteger(..)` for pre-ES6:

```js
if (!Number.isInteger) {
	Number.isInteger = function(num) {
		return typeof num == "number" && num % 1 == 0;
	};
}
```

* To test if a value is a *safe integer*, use the ES6-specified `Number.isSafeInteger(..)`:

```js
Number.isSafeInteger( Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER );	// true
Number.isSafeInteger( Math.pow( 2, 53 ) );			// false
Number.isSafeInteger( Math.pow( 2, 53 ) - 1 );		// true
```

### 32-bit (Signed) Integers
* While integers can range up to roughly 9 quadrillion `safely` (53 bits), there are some numeric operations (like the `bitwise` operators) that are `only defined for` `32-bit numbers`, so the "`safe range`" for `number`s used in `that way` [... is `Math.pow(-2,31)` (`-2147483648`, about -2.1 billion) up to `Math.pow(2,31)-1` (`2147483647`, about +2.1 billion).

* To `force` a `number` value in `a` to a `32-bit signed integer value`, use `a | 0`. This works because the `|` bitwise operator `only works` for `32-bit integer values` (meaning it can only pay attention to 32 bits and any `other bits will be lost`). Then, "or'ing" with zero is essentially a no-op bitwise speaking.

* Certain `special values` [...] such as `NaN` and `Infinity` are `not "32-bit safe,"` in that those values when passed to a bitwise operator will pass through the abstract operation `ToInt32` [...] and become simply the `+0` value for the purpose of that `bitwise operation`.

## Special Values
### The Non-value Values
* For the `undefined` type, there is one and only one value: `undefined`. For the `null` type, there is one and only one value: `null`. So for both of them, the label is both its type and its value.

* Both `undefined` and `null` are often taken to be `interchangeable` as either "empty" values or "non" values. Other developers prefer to `distinguish` between them with nuance. For example:

* `null` is an empty value
* `undefined` is a missing value

Or:

* `undefined` hasn't had a value yet
* `null` had a value and doesn't anymore

* `null` is a special keyword, `not an identifier`, and thus you cannot treat it `as a variable` to assign to [...] However, `undefined` *is* [...] an `identifier`.

### Undefined
* In `non-strict` mode, it's actually possible [...] to assign a value to the globally provided `undefined` identifier:

```js
function foo() {
	undefined = 2; // really bad idea!
}

foo();
```

```js
function foo() {
	"use strict";
	undefined = 2; // TypeError!
}

foo();
```

* In both non-`strict` mode and `strict` mode, however, you can `create` a local variable of the name `undefined`. But again, this is a terrible idea!

```js
function foo() {
	"use strict";
	var undefined = 2;
	console.log( undefined ); // 2
}

foo();
```

#### `void` Operator
* While `undefined` is a `built-in identifier` (me: see the above argument) that holds [...] the built-in `undefined` value, `another way` to get this value is the `void` operator.

* The expression `void ___` `"voids" out` `any value`, so that the result of the expression is `always` the `undefined` value. It `doesn't modify` the existing value; it just ensures that no value comes back from the operator expression.

```js
var a = 42;

console.log( void a, a ); // undefined 42
```

* By convention [...] to represent the `undefined` value stand-alone by using `void`, you'd use `void 0` (though clearly even `void true` or any other `void` expression does the same thing). There's no practical difference between `void 0`, `void 1`, and `undefined`.

* the `void` operator can be useful in a few other circumstances, if you need to ensure that an expression `has no result value` (`even if` it has `side effects`).

```js
function doSomething() {
	// note: `APP.ready` is provided by our application
	if (!APP.ready) {
		// try again later
		return void setTimeout( doSomething, 100 );
	}

	var result;

	// do some other stuff
	return result;
}

// were we able to do it right away?
if (doSomething()) {
	// handle next tasks right away
}
```

* the `setTimeout(..)` function returns a `numeric value` (the `unique identifier` of the `timer interval`, if you wanted to cancel it), but we want to `void` that out so that the return value of our function doesn't give a (CKL)(`false-positive`) with the `if` statement.

* (me: this) works the same but doesn't use the `void` operator:

```js
if (!APP.ready) {
	// try again later
	setTimeout( doSomething, 100 );
	return;
}
```

### Special Numbers
#### The Not Number, Number
* Any mathematic operation you perform without both operands being `number`s (or values that `can be interpreted` as regular `number`s in `base 10` or `base 16`) will result in the operation `failing to produce a valid` `number`, in which case you will get the `NaN` value [...] stands for "not a `number`", though [...] It would be much more accurate to think of `NaN` as being "invalid number," "failed number,".

```js
var a = 2 / "foo";		// NaN

typeof a === "number";	// true
```

* `NaN` is a kind of "sentinel value" [...] represents a special kind of `error condition` within the `number` set. The `error condition` is [...] "I tried to perform a mathematic operation but failed, so here's the failed `number` result instead."

* `NaN` is a very special value in that it's [...] never equal to itself.

* So how *do* we test for it, if we can't compare to `NaN` (since that comparison would always fail)?

```js
var a = 2 / "foo";

isNaN( a ); // true
```

* Not so fast [...] The `isNaN(..)` utility has a `fatal flaw` [...] (me: it) "test if the thing passed in is either not a `number` or is a `number`."

```js
var a = 2 / "foo";
var b = "foo";

a; // NaN
b; // "foo"

window.isNaN( a ); // true
window.isNaN( b ); // true -- ouch!
```

* `"foo"` is literally *not a `number`*, but it's `definitely not` the `NaN` value either! This `bug` has been in JS since the very beginning.

* As of `ES6`, finally a replacement utility [...] `Number.isNaN(..)`. A simple `polyfill` for it so that you can safely check `NaN` values [...] in `pre-ES6 browsers`.

```js
if (!Number.isNaN) {
	Number.isNaN = function(n) {
		return (
			typeof n === "number" &&
			window.isNaN( n )
		);
	};
}

var a = 2 / "foo";
var b = "foo";

Number.isNaN( a ); // true
Number.isNaN( b ); // false -- phew!
```

* we can implement a `Number.isNaN(..)` polyfill even easier, by taking advantage of that peculiar fact that `NaN` (me: is the `only` value) isn't equal to itself.

```js
if (!Number.isNaN) {
	Number.isNaN = function(n) {
		return n !== n;
	};
}
```

#### Infinities
* (WCRL).

#### Zeros
* JavaScript has both a normal zero `0` (otherwise known as a positive zero `+0`) *and* a negative zero `-0`.

* Besides being specified literally as `-0`, negative zero also results from certain mathematic operations. For example:

```js
var a = 0 / -3; // -0
var b = 0 * -3; // -0
```

* `Addition` and `subtraction` cannot result in a negative zero.

* A `negative zero` when examined in the `developer console` will usually reveal `-0`, though [...] some older browsers you encounter may still report it as `0`.

* However, if you try to `stringify` a `negative zero value`, it will `always` be reported as `"0"`.

```js
var a = 0 / -3;

// (some browser) consoles at least get it right
a;							// -0

// but the spec insists on lying to you!
a.toString();				// "0"
a + "";						// "0"
String( a );				// "0"

// strangely, even JSON gets in on the deception
JSON.stringify( a );		// "0"
```

* Interestingly, the `reverse operations` (going from `string` to `number`) don't lie:

```js
+"-0";				// -0
Number( "-0" );		// -0
JSON.parse( "-0" );	// -0
```

* (CKL)(The `JSON.stringify( -0 )` behavior of `"0"` is particularly strange when you observe that it's inconsistent with the reverse: `JSON.parse( "-0" )` reports `-0` as you'd correctly expect).

* In addition to stringification of negative zero being deceptive to hide its true value, the comparison operators are also (`intentionally`) configured to *lie*.

```js
var a = 0;
var b = 0 / -3;

a == b;		// true
-0 == 0;	// true

a === b;	// true
-0 === 0;	// true

0 > -0;		// false
a > b;		// false
```

* if you want to distinguish a `-0` from a `0` in your code, you `can't` just rely on what the `developer console outputs`, so you're going to have to be a bit more clever:

```js
function isNegZero(n) {
	n = Number( n );
	return (n === 0) && (1 / n === -Infinity);
}

isNegZero( -0 );		// true
isNegZero( 0 / -3 );	// true
isNegZero( 0 );			// false
```

* `why` do we need a negative zero [...] There are `certain applications` where developers use the `magnitude of a value` to represent one piece of information (like speed of movement per animation frame) and the (me: the `sign` before a number. For instance: `+3`)(`sign`) of that `number` to `represent another piece of information` (like the `direction of that movement`).

### Special Equality
* the `NaN` value and the `-0` value have `special behavior` when it comes to equality comparison. `NaN` is never equal to itself, so you have to use ES6's `Number.isNaN(..)` (or a polyfill). Similarly, `-0` lies and pretends that it's equal (even `===` strict equal [...]) to regular positive `0`, so you have to use the somewhat hackish `isNegZero(..)`.

* As of ES6, there's a new utility that can be used to test two values for `absolute equality`, without any of these exceptions. It's called `Object.is(..)`:

```js
var a = 2 / "foo";
var b = -3 * 0;

Object.is( a, NaN );	// true
Object.is( b, -0 );		// true

Object.is( b, 0 );		// false
```

* (me: a) simple polyfill for `Object.is(..)` for pre-ES6 environments:

```js
if (!Object.is) {
	Object.is = function(v1, v2) {
		// test for `-0`
		if (v1 === 0 && v2 === 0) {
			return 1 / v1 === 1 / v2;
		}
		// test for `NaN`
		if (v1 !== v1) {
			return v2 !== v2;
		}
		// everything else
		return v1 === v2;
	};
}
```

* `Object.is(..)` probably shouldn't be used in cases where `==` or `===` are known to be *safe* [...] `Object.is(..)` is mostly for these special cases of equality.

## Value vs. Reference
* A reference in JS points at a (`shared`) **value**, so if you have 10 [...] references, they are all always `distinct` references to a `single shared value`.

* in JavaScript [...] the *type* of the value *solely* controls whether that value will be assigned by `value-copy` or by `reference-copy`.

```js
var a = 2;
var b = a; // `b` is always a copy of the value in `a`
b++;
a; // 2
b; // 3

var c = [1,2,3];
var d = c; // `d` is a reference to the shared `[1,2,3]` value
d.push( 4 );
c; // [1,2,3,4]
d; // [1,2,3,4]
```

* Simple values (aka [...] primitives) are *always* assigned/passed by `value-copy`: `null`, `undefined`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and ES6's `symbol`.

* Compound values -- `object`s [...] *always* create a `copy of` the `reference` on assignment or passing.

* In the above snippet, because `2` is a [...] primitive [...] `b` is assigned another *copy* of the value. When changing `b`, you are in no way changing the value in `a`.

* But **both `c` and `d`** are separate `references` to the same `shared value` `[1,2,3]` [...] a compound value [...] `neither` `c` nor `d` [...] "owns" the `[1,2,3]` value [...] So, when using either reference to modify (`.push(4)`) the actual shared `array` value [...] it's affecting just the one shared value, and both references will reference the `newly modified value` `[1,2,3,4]`.

* you cannot use one reference to change where another reference is pointed:

```js
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = a;
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [1,2,3]

// later
b = [4,5,6];
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [4,5,6]
```

* When we make the assignment `b = [4,5,6]`, we are doing absolutely nothing to affect [...] `a` (me: which) is still referencing (`[1,2,3]`). To do that, `b` would have to be a pointer to `a` `rather than` a reference to the `array` -- but no such capability exists in JS!

* Remember: you cannot directly control/override value-copy vs. reference -- those semantics are controlled `entirely` by the type of the underlying value.

* To effectively pass a compound value (like an `array`) by `value-copy`, you need to `manually` make a copy of it, so that the reference passed doesn't still point to the original.

```js
a = [1, 2, 3] // (me)
foo( a.slice() );
```

* `slice(..)` with `no parameters` by default makes an `entirely new (shallow) copy` of the `array`. So, we pass in a reference only to the copied `array`, and thus `foo(..)` cannot affect the contents of `a`.

* To do the `reverse` -- pass a [...] primitive value in a way where its value updates can be seen (me: by the function receiving the value), kinda like a reference -- you have to (me: leverage the reference-copy feature of a compound value by wrapping) the value in another compound value.

```js
function foo(wrapper) {
	wrapper.a = 42;
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo( obj );

obj.a; // 42
```

* It may occur to you that if you wanted to pass in a reference to a [...] primitive value like `2`, you could just box the value in its `Number` object wrapper [...] It *is* true a copy of the reference to this `Number` object *will* be passed to the function, but `unfortunately`, having a reference to the [...] object is not going to give you the ability to modify the [...] primitive value, like you may expect:

```js
function foo(x) {
	x = x + 1;
	x; // 3
}

var a = 2;
var b = new Number( a ); // or equivalently `Object(a)`

foo( b );
console.log( b ); // 2, not 3
```

* The problem is that the underlying [...] primitive value is *not mutable* [...] If a `Number` object holds the [...] primitive value `2`, that exact `Number` object can `never be changed` to hold another value.

* When `x` is used in the expression `x + 1`, the underlying [...] primitive value `2` is unboxed (extracted) from the `Number` object automatically, so the line `x = x + 1` very subtly changes `x` `from` being a **shared reference to the `Number` object**, `to` just holding the [...] primitive value `3` as a result of the addition operation `2 + 1`. Therefore, `b` on the outside still references the original unmodified/immutable `Number` object holding the value `2`.

## Review

# Chapter 3: Natives
* a list of the most commonly used natives:

* `String()`
* `Number()`
* `Boolean()`
* `Array()`
* `Object()`
* `Function()`
* `RegExp()`
* `Date()`
* `Error()`
* `Symbol()` -- added in ES6!

* As you can see, these natives are actually built-in functions.

```js
var a = new String( "abc" );

typeof a; // "object" ... not "String"

a instanceof String; // true

Object.prototype.toString.call( a ); // "[object String]"
```

* The result of the constructor form of value creation (`new String("abc")`) is an object wrapper around the primitive (`"abc"`) value [...] Importantly, `typeof` shows that these objects [...] are subtypes of the `object` type.

* The point is, `new String("abc")` creates a string wrapper object around `"abc"`, not just the primitive `"abc"` value itself.

## Internal `[[Class]]`
* Values that are `typeof` `"object"` (such as an array) are additionally tagged with an internal `[[Class]]` property (think of this more as an internal *classification* `rather than` related to classes from `traditional class-oriented coding`). This property cannot be accessed `directly`, but can generally be revealed indirectly by borrowing the default `Object.prototype.toString(..)` method called against the value. For example:

```js
Object.prototype.toString.call( [1,2,3] );			// "[object Array]"

Object.prototype.toString.call( /regex-literal/i );	// "[object RegExp]"
```

* So, for the array in this example, the internal `[[Class]]` value is `"Array"`, and for the regular expression, it's `"RegExp"`. In most cases, this internal `[[Class]]` value corresponds to the `built-in native constructor` [...] related to the value, but that's not always the case.

What about primitive values? First, `null` and `undefined`:

```js
Object.prototype.toString.call( null );			// "[object Null]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( undefined );	// "[object Undefined]"
```

* there are no `Null()` or `Undefined()` native constructors, `but nevertheless` the `"Null"` and `"Undefined"` are the internal `[[Class]]` values exposed.

* But for the other simple primitives like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`, another behavior actually kicks in, which is usually called "`boxing`" (see "Boxing Wrappers" section next):

```js
Object.prototype.toString.call( "abc" );	// "[object String]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( 42 );		// "[object Number]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( true );		// "[object Boolean]"
```

* In this snippet, each of the simple primitives are `automatically boxed` by their respective `object wrappers`, which is why `"String"`, `"Number"`, and `"Boolean"` are revealed as the respective internal `[[Class]]` values.

* The behavior of `toString()` and `[[Class]]` as illustrated here has changed a bit from ES5 to ES6, but we cover those details in the *ES6 & Beyond* title of this series.

## Boxing Wrappers
* Primitive values don't have properties or methods, so to access `.length` or `.toString()` you need an object wrapper around the value. Thankfully, JS will automatically *box* (aka wrap) the primitive value to fulfill such accesses.

```js
var a = "abc";

a.length; // 3
a.toUpperCase(); // "ABC"
```

* if you're going to be accessing these properties/methods on your string values regularly, like a `i < a.length` condition in a `for` loop for instance, `it might seem` [...] to just have the object form of the value `from the start`, so the JS engine doesn't need to `implicitly` create it for you.

* But [...] that's a bad idea. Browsers `long ago` `performance-optimized` the common cases like `.length`, which means your program will *actually go slower* if you try to "preoptimize" by directly using the object form (which isn't on the optimized path).

### Object Wrapper Gotchas
* There are some `gotchas` with using the object wrappers directly.

```js
var a = new Boolean( false );

if (!a) {
	console.log( "Oops" ); // never runs
}
```

* The problem is that you've created an `object wrapper` around the `false` value, but objects themselves are "`truthy`" [... ]which is [...] contrary to normal expectation.

* you can (me: also) use the `Object(..)` function (no `new` keyword):

```js
var a = "abc";
var b = new String( a );
var c = Object( a );

typeof a; // "string"
typeof b; // "object"
typeof c; // "object"

b instanceof String; // true
c instanceof String; // true

Object.prototype.toString.call( b ); // "[object String]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( c ); // "[object String]"
```

## Unboxing
* use the `valueOf()` method:

```js
var a = new String( "abc" );
var b = new Number( 42 );
var c = new Boolean( true );

a.valueOf(); // "abc"
b.valueOf(); // 42
c.valueOf(); // true
```

* Unboxing can also happen `implicitly` [...] This process (coercion) will be covered in more detail in Chapter 4.

```js
var a = new String( "abc" );
var b = a + ""; // `b` has the unboxed primitive value "abc"

typeof a; // "object"
typeof b; // "string"
```

## Natives as Constructors
* For `array`, `object`, `function`, and `regular-expression` values, it's [...] preferred that you use the literal form for creating the values, `but` the literal form creates the `same sort of object` `as the constructor form does`.

### `Array(..)`
```js
var a = new Array( 1, 2, 3 );
a; // [1, 2, 3]

var b = [1, 2, 3];
b; // [1, 2, 3]
```

* The `Array(..)` constructor `does not` require the `new` keyword.

* The `Array` constructor has a special form where if `only one` `number` argument is passed [...] it's taken as a length to "presize the array" (well, sorta).

* This is a terrible idea [...] what you're creating is an otherwise **empty array**, `but` setting the `length` property of the array to the numeric value specified.

* An array with at least one "empty slot" in it is often called a "`sparse array`."

* this is yet another example where browser developer consoles vary on how they represent such an object.

```js
var a = new Array( 3 );

a.length; // 3
a;
```

* The serialization of `a` in Chrome is (at the time of writing): `[ undefined x 3 ]`. **This is really unfortunate.** It implies that there are three `undefined` values in the slots of this array, when `in fact` the slots **do not exist** [...] To visualize the difference, try this:

```js
var a = new Array( 3 );
var b = [ undefined, undefined, undefined ];
var c = [];
c.length = 3;

a;
b;
c;
```

* **Note:** Changing the `length` of an array to go beyond its number of actually-defined slot values, you implicitly introduce empty slots. In fact, you could even call `delete b[1]` in the above snippet, and it would introduce an empty slot into the middle of `b`.

* For `b` (in Chrome, currently), you'll find `[ undefined, undefined, undefined ]` as the serialization, as opposed to `[ undefined x 3 ]` for `a` and `c`.

* Worse than that, at the time of writing, Firefox reports `[ , , , ]` for `a` and `c` [...] `Three commas` implies `four slots`, not `three` slots like we'd expect [...] Firefox puts an extra `,` on the end of their serialization here because as of `ES5`, trailing commas in lists (array values, property lists, etc.) are `allowed` [...] a `[ , , , ]` value [...] actually [...] (me: is) `[ , , ]`.

* Unfortunately, it gets worse [...] `a` and `b` from the above code snippet actually behave the same in some cases **but differently in others**:

```js
a.join( "-" ); // "--"
b.join( "-" ); // "--"

a.map(function(v,i){ return i; }); // [ undefined x 3 ]
b.map(function(v,i){ return i; }); // [ 0, 1, 2 ]
```

* The `a.map(..)` call *fails* because the slots `don't actually exist` [...] `join(..)` works differently [...] we can think of it implemented sort of like this:

```js
function fakeJoin(arr,connector) {
	var str = "";
	for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		if (i > 0) {
			str += connector;
		}
		if (arr[i] !== undefined) {
			str += arr[i];
		}
	}
	return str;
}

var a = new Array( 3 );
fakeJoin( a, "-" ); // "--"

// (me)
var a = [1, 2];
fakeJoin( a, "-" ); // "1-2"
```

* to *actually* create an array of actual `undefined` values (not just "empty slots")

```js
var a = Array.apply( null, { length: 3 } );
a; // [ undefined, undefined, undefined ]
```

* The first argument is a `this` object binding [...] which we don't care about here, so we set it to `null`. The second argument is supposed to be an array (or [...] an "array-like object"). The `contents of` this "array" are "spread" out `as arguments` to the function in question.

* Inside of `apply(..)`, we can envision there's another `for` loop [...] that goes from `0` `up to`, but not including, `length` (`3` in our case) [...] For each index, it retrieves that key from the object. So if the `array-object parameter` was named `arr` internally [...] the property access would [...] be `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`. Of course, none of those properties exist on the [...] object value, so all three of those property accesses would return the value `undefined`.

* In other words, it ends up calling `Array(..)` basically like this: `Array(undefined,undefined,undefined)`.

### `Object(..)`, `Function(..)`, and `RegExp(..)`
* There's practically no reason to ever use the `new Object()` constructor form.

* The `Function` constructor is helpful only in the rarest of cases, where you need to `dynamically` define a function's parameters and/or its function body.

* Regular expressions defined in the literal form (`/^a*b+/g`) are [...] preferred, not just for ease of syntax but for performance reasons -- the JS engine precompiles and caches them before code execution. Unlike the other constructor forms we've seen so far, `RegExp(..)` has some reasonable utility: to `dynamically define the pattern` for a regular expression.

```js
var name = "Kyle";
var namePattern = new RegExp( "\\b(?:" + name + ")+\\b", "ig" );

var matches = someText.match( namePattern );
```

### `Date(..)` and `Error(..)`
* The `Date(..)` and `Error(..)` native constructors are much more useful than the other natives, because there is no literal form for either.

* To create a date object value, you must use `new Date()`. The `Date(..)` constructor accepts optional arguments to specify the date/time to use, but if omitted, the current date/time is assumed.

* By far the most common reason you construct a date object is to get the current `timestamp value` (a signed integer number of `milliseconds` since Jan 1, 1970). You can do this by calling `getTime()` on a date object instance [...] But an even easier way is to just call the static helper function defined as of ES5: `Date.now()`.

* If you call `Date()` without `new`, you'll get back a `string` representation of the date/time at that moment. The exact form of this representation is not specified in the language spec, though browsers tend to agree on something close to: `"Fri Jul 18 2014 00:31:02 GMT-0500 (CDT)"`.

* The `Error(..)` constructor [...] behaves the same with the `new` keyword present or omitted.

* The main reason you'd want to create an error object is that it captures the `current execution stack context` into the object (in most JS engines, revealed as a read-only `.stack` property once (me: the object) constructed). This `stack context` `includes` the function call-stack and the line-number where the error object was created, which makes debugging that error much easier.

* Error object instances generally have at least a `message` property, and sometimes other properties (which you should treat as read-only), like `type`. However, other than inspecting the above-mentioned `stack` property, it's usually best to just call `toString()` on the error object [...] to get a friendly-formatted error message.

* in addition to the general `Error(..)` native, there are several other specific-error-type natives: `EvalError(..)`, `RangeError(..)`, `ReferenceError(..)`, `SyntaxError(..)`, `TypeError(..)`, and `URIError(..)`. But it's very rare to manually use these specific error natives.

### `Symbol(..)`
* New as of ES6, an additional primitive value type has been added [...] "Symbol" [...] special "`unique`" (`not strictly guaranteed`!) values that can be used as properties on objects with `little fear of any collision`. They're primarily designed for `special built-in behaviors` of ES6 constructs, but you can also define your own symbols.

```js
// (me)
a = Symbol( "my own symbol" );
b = Symbol( "my own symbol" );

b === a // false
a       // Symbol(my own symbol)
b       // Symbol(my own symbol)
```

* you cannot see or access the `actual` value of a symbol from your program, nor from the developer console.

* There are several `predefined symbols` in ES6, accessed as static properties of the `Symbol` function object, like `Symbol.create`, `Symbol.iterator`, etc.

```js
obj[Symbol.iterator] = function(){ /*..*/ };
```

* To define your own custom symbols, use the `Symbol(..)` native. The `Symbol(..)` native "constructor" is unique in that you're `not allowed` to use `new` with it, as doing so will throw an error.

```js
var mysym = Symbol( "my own symbol" );
mysym;				// Symbol(my own symbol)
mysym.toString();	// "Symbol(my own symbol)"
typeof mysym; 		// "symbol"

var a = { };
a[mysym] = "foobar";

Object.getOwnPropertySymbols( a );
// [ Symbol(my own symbol) ]
```

* While symbols are not actually private (`Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(..)` reflects on the object and reveals the symbols quite publicly), using them for private or special properties is likely their primary use-case. For most developers, they may take the place of property names with `_` underscore prefixes, which are almost always by convention signals to say, "hey, this is a private/special/internal property, so leave it alone!"

* `Symbol`s are *not* `object`s, they are simple [...] primitives.

### Native Prototypes
* By documentation convention, `String.prototype.XYZ` is shortened to `String#XYZ`, and likewise for all the other `.prototype`s.
  * `String#indexOf(..)`: find the position in the string of another substring
  * `String#charAt(..)`: access the character at a position in the string
  * `String#substr(..)`, `String#substring(..)`, and `String#slice(..)`: extract a portion of the string as a new string
  * `String#toUpperCase()` and `String#toLowerCase()`: create a new string that's converted to either uppercase or lowercase
  * `String#trim()`: create a new string that's stripped of any trailing or leading whitespace

* some of the (me: `prototype` properties of native functions)(native prototypes) aren't *just* plain objects:

```js
typeof Function.prototype;			// "function"
Function.prototype();				// it's an empty function!

RegExp.prototype.toString();		// "/(?:)/" -- empty regex
"abc".match( RegExp.prototype );	// [""]
```

* you can even modify these native prototypes.

```js
Array.isArray( Array.prototype );	// true
Array.prototype.push( 1, 2, 3 );	// 3
Array.prototype;					// [1,2,3]

// don't leave it that way, though, or expect weirdness!
// reset the `Array.prototype` to empty
Array.prototype.length = 0;
```

* As you can see, `Function.prototype` is a function, `RegExp.prototype` is a regular expression, and `Array.prototype` is an array. Interesting and cool, huh?

#### Prototypes As Defaults
* `Function.prototype` being an `empty function`, `RegExp.prototype` being an "empty" [...] regex, and `Array.prototype` being an empty array, make them all nice "default" values to assign to variables.

```js
function isThisCool(vals,fn,rx) {
	vals = vals || Array.prototype;
	fn = fn || Function.prototype;
	rx = rx || RegExp.prototype;

	return rx.test(
		vals.map( fn ).join( "" )
	);
}

isThisCool();		// true

isThisCool(
	["a","b","c"],
	function(v){ return v.toUpperCase(); },
	/D/
);					// false
```

* One minor side-benefit of this approach is that the `.prototype`s are `already created and built-in`, thus created *only once*. By contrast, using `[]`, `function(){}`, and `/(?:)/` values themselves for those defaults would (likely, `depending on engine implementations`) be `recreating` those values [...] That could be memory/CPU wasteful.

* Also, be `very careful` not to use `Array.prototype` as a default value **that will subsequently be modified**. In this example, `vals` is used `read-only`, but if you were to instead make in-place changes to `vals`, you would actually be modifying `Array.prototype` itself.

* While we're pointing out these native prototypes and some usefulness, be `cautious` of relying on [...] (me: and) modifying them [...] See `Appendix A`.

## Review

# Chapter 4: Coercion
## Converting Values
* JavaScript coercions `always` result in one of the [...] primitive [...] values [...] There is no coercion that results in a complex value like `object` or `function`. Chapter 3 covers "boxing," which wraps [...] primitive values in their `object` counterparts, but this is `not really coercion` in an accurate sense.

## Abstract Value Operations
* The `ES5` spec in section 9 defines several "`abstract operations`" (fancy spec-speak for "`internal-only operation`") with the rules of value conversion.

### `ToString`
* When any `non-string` value is coerced to a `string` representation, the conversion is handled by the `ToString` abstract operation.

* Built-in primitive values have natural stringification: `null` becomes `"null"`, `undefined` becomes `"undefined"` and `true` becomes `"true"`. `number`s are [...] (me: as what) you'd expect, but as we discussed in Chapter 2, very small or very large `numbers` are represented in exponent form:

* For regular objects [...] the default `toString()` (located in `Object.prototype.toString()`) will return the *internal `[[Class]]`* (see `Chapter 3`) [...] for instance `"[object Object]"` [...] if an object has its own `toString()` method on it, and you use that object in a `string-like` way, its `toString()` will automatically be called, and the `string` result of that call will be used instead.

* Arrays have an overridden default `toString()` that stringifies `as` the (string) concatenation of all its values [...] with `","` in between each value:

```js
var a = [1,2,3];

a.toString(); // "1,2,3"
```

* `toString()` can either be called explicitly, or it will automatically be called if a `non-string` is used in a `string context`.

#### JSON Stringification
* Another task that seems awfully related to `ToString` is when you use the `JSON.stringify(..)` [...] this stringification is not exactly the same thing as coercion.

* For most simple values, JSON stringification behaves basically the same as `toString()` conversions.

```js
JSON.stringify( 42 );	// "42"
JSON.stringify( "42" );	// ""42"" (a string with a quoted string value in it)
JSON.stringify( null );	// "null"
JSON.stringify( true );	// "true"
```

* Any *JSON-safe* value (me: Any value that can be represented `validly` in a JSON representation) can be stringified by `JSON.stringify(..)`.

* It may be easier to consider values that are **not** JSON-safe. Some examples: `undefined`s, `function`s, (ES6+) `symbol`s, and `object`s with `circular references` (where property references in an object structure create a never-ending cycle through each other). These are all illegal values for a standard JSON structure, mostly because they **aren't portable to other languages** that consume JSON values.

* The `JSON.stringify(..)` utility will **automatically omit** `undefined`, `function`, and `symbol` values when it comes across them. If such a value is found in an `array`, that value is replaced by `null` [...] If found as a property of an `object`, that property will simply be `excluded`.

Consider:

```js
JSON.stringify( undefined );					// undefined
JSON.stringify( function(){} );					// undefined

JSON.stringify( [1,undefined,function(){},4] );	// "[1,null,null,4]"
JSON.stringify( { a:2, b:function(){} } );		// "{"a":2}"
```

* if you try to `JSON.stringify(..)` an `object` with circular reference(s) in it, an error will be thrown.

* JSON stringification has the `special behavior` that if an `object` value has a `toJSON()` method defined, `this method` will be called `first` to get a value to use for serialization.

* `If you [...] JSON stringify an object` that may contain `illegal JSON value(s)`, or if you just have values in the `object` that aren't appropriate for the serialization, you should define a `toJSON()` method for it that returns a *JSON-safe* version of the `object` [...] For example:

```js
var o = { };

var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: o,
	d: function(){}
};

// create a circular reference inside `a`
o.e = a;

// would throw an error on the circular reference
// JSON.stringify( a );

// define a custom JSON value serialization
a.toJSON = function() {
	// only include the `b` property for serialization
	return { b: this.b };
};

JSON.stringify( a ); // "{"b":42}"
```

* a very common misconception that `toJSON()` should return a JSON stringification representation. That's probably incorrect [...] `toJSON()` should return the actual regular value (of whatever type) that's appropriate, and `JSON.stringify(..)` itself will handle the stringification.

* An optional second argument can be passed to `JSON.stringify(..)` that is called *replacer*. This argument can either be an `array` or a `function`. It's used to customize the recursive serialization of an `object` by providing a filtering mechanism for which properties should and should not be included, in a similar way to how `toJSON()` can prepare a value for serialization.

* If *replacer* is an `array`, it should be an `array` of `string`s, each of which will specify a `property name` that is allowed to be included in the serialization of the `object`. If a property exists that isn't in this list, it will be skipped.

* If *replacer* is a `function`, it will be called once for the `object` itself, and then once for each property in the `object`, and each time is passed two arguments, *key* and *value*. To skip a *key* in the serialization, return `undefined`. Otherwise, return the *value* provided.

```js
var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: "42",
	d: [1,2,3]
};

JSON.stringify( a, ["b","c"] ); // "{"b":42,"c":"42"}"

JSON.stringify( a, function(k,v){
	if (k !== "c") return v;
} );
// "{"b":42,"d":[1,2,3]}"
```

* In the `function` *replacer* case, the key argument `k` is `undefined` for the `first call` (where the `a` object `itself` is being passed in). The `if` statement **filters out** the property named `"c"`. Stringification is `recursive`, so the `[1,2,3]` array has each of its values (`1`, `2`, and `3`) passed as `v` to *replacer*, with indexes (`0`, `1`, and `2`) as `k`.

* A third optional argument can also be passed to `JSON.stringify(..)`, called *space*, which is used as `indentation` for prettier human-friendly output. *space* can be a positive integer to indicate how many space characters should be used at each indentation level. Or, *space* can be a `string`, in which case up to the first ten characters of its value will be used for each indentation level.

```js
var a = {
	b: 42,
	c: "42",
	d: [1,2,3]
};

JSON.stringify( a, null, 3 );
// "{
//    "b": 42,
//    "c": "42",
//    "d": [
//       1,
//       2,
//       3
//    ]
// }"

JSON.stringify( a, null, "-----" );
// "{
// -----"b": 42,
// -----"c": "42",
// -----"d": [
// ----------1,
// ----------2,
// ----------3
// -----]
// }"
```

1. `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `null` values all stringify for JSON basically the same as how they coerce to `string` values via the rules of the `ToString` abstract operation.
2. If you pass an `object` value to `JSON.stringify(..)`, and that `object` has a `toJSON()` method on it, `toJSON()` is automatically called to (sort of) "coerce" the value to be *JSON-safe* before stringification.

### ToNumber
* If any `non-number` value is used in a way that requires it to be a `number`, such as a `mathematical operation`, the ES5 spec defines the `ToNumber` abstract operation

* For example, `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`. `undefined` becomes `NaN`, but (curiously) `null` becomes `0`.

* `ToNumber` for a `string` value essentially works [...] like the `rules/syntax for numeric literals` (see `Chapter 3` in the section talking about the `Number` native function) If it fails, the result is `NaN` [...] One [...] difference is that `0`-`prefixed octal numbers` are not handled as octals (just as normal `base-10 decimals`) in this operation, though such octals are valid as `number` literals (see Chapter 2).

* **Note:** The `differences` between `number literal` `grammar` and `ToNumber` on a string value are `subtle` [...] and thus will not be covered further here. Consult section 9.3.1 of the ES5 spec for more information.

* Objects (and arrays) (me: which are passed to the `ToNumber function`) will first be converted to their `primitive value equivalent` (me: see how in the next argument), and the resulting value (if a primitive but `not already` a `number`) is coerced to a `number` according to the `ToNumber` rules just mentioned.

* To convert to this `primitive value equivalent`, (me: the rest of this argument indicate how the `ToPrimitive` works) the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation [...] will consult the value (using the internal `DefaultValue` operation -- ES5 spec, section 8.12.8) in question to see if it has a `valueOf()` method. If `valueOf()` is available and it returns a primitive value, *that* value is used for the coercion. If not, but `toString()` is available, (me: the `toString()` function)(it) will provide the value for the coercion [...] If neither operation can provide a primitive value, a `TypeError` is thrown.

* As of ES5, you can create such a `noncoercible object` (me: an object without `valueOf()` and `toString()`) if it has a `null` value for its `[[Prototype]]`, typically created with `Object.create(null)`.

Consider:

```js
var a = {
	valueOf: function(){
		return "42";
	}
};

var b = {
	toString: function(){
		return "42";
	}
};

var c = [4,2];
c.toString = function(){
	return this.join( "" );	// "42"
};

Number( a );			// 42
Number( b );			// 42
Number( c );			// 42
Number( "" );			// 0
Number( [] );			// 0
Number( [ "abc" ] );	// NaN
```

### `ToBoolean`
* First and foremost, JS has actual keywords `true` and `false`, and they behave exactly as you'd expect of `boolean` values. It's a common misconception that the values `1` and `0` are identical to `true`/`false`.

#### Falsy Values
* All of JavaScript's values can be divided into two categories:
  1. values that will become `false` if coerced to `boolean`.
  2. everything else [...] `true`.

* "falsy" values list:
   * `undefined`
   * `null`
   * `false`
   * `+0`, `-0`, and `NaN`
   * `""`

* if a value is *not* on that list (me: then they are `truthy`) [...] But JS doesn't really define a "truthy" list [...] mostly the spec just implies: **anything not explicitly on the falsy list is therefore truthy.**

#### Falsy Objects
* **all `objects` (me: are) truthy** [...] There should be no such thing as a "`falsy object`." [...] You might be tempted to think it means an object wrapper [...] around a falsy value [...] But don't fall into that *trap*.

```js
var a = new Boolean( false );
var b = new Number( 0 );
var c = new String( "" );
```

* all three values here are objects [...] wrapped around [...] falsy values. But do these objects behave as `true` or as `false`?

```js
var d = Boolean( a && b && c );

d; // true
```

* So, all three behave as `true`, as that's the only way `d` could end up as `true`.

* **Tip:** Notice the `Boolean( .. )` wrapped around the `a && b && c` expression -- you might wonder why that's there. We'll come back to that later in this chapter [...] (me: but) try for yourself what `d` will be if you just do `d = a && b && c` without the `Boolean( .. )` call!

* So, if **"falsy objects" are not just `objects wrapped around falsy values`**, what the heck are they? [...] (me: they are) **not actually part of JavaScript itself** [...] There are [...] cases where browsers have created their own [...] values behavior [...] (me: such as) "`falsy objects`," `on top of` regular JS [...] A "falsy object" is a value that looks and acts like a `normal` object (properties, etc.), but when you coerce it to a `boolean`, it coerces to a `false` value.

* **Why!?**

* The most well-known case is `document.all`: `an array-like (object)` provided [...] *by the DOM* (not the JS engine itself) [...] exposes elements in your page [...] It *used* to [...] act truthy. But not anymore [...] `document.all` [...] has [...] been deprecated [...] (me: But) `if (document.all) { /* it's IE */ }` code is still out there [...] So, we can't remove `document.all` completely [...] so [...] new, standards-compliant code logic [...] `document.all` is falsy!"

#### Truthy Values
* the truthy list is `infinitely long`. It's impossible to make such a list. You can only make a `finite falsy list` and consult *it*.

## Explicit Coercion
### Explicitly: Strings <--> Numbers
* To coerce between `string`s and `number`s, we use the built-in `String(..)` and `Number(..)` functions [...] but **very importantly**, we do not use the `new` keyword in front of them. As such, we're `not creating object wrappers` [...] Instead, we're actually *explicitly coercing* between the two types:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = String( a );

var c = "3.14";
var d = Number( c );

b; // "42"
d; // 3.14
```

* `String(..)` coerces from `any other value` to a primitive `string` value, using the rules of the `ToString` operation [...] `Number(..)` coerces from any other value to a primitive `number` value, using the rules of the `ToNumber` operation.

* Besides `String(..)` and `Number(..)`, there are other ways to "explicitly" convert these values between `string` and `number`:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a.toString();

var c = "3.14";
var d = +c;

b; // "42"
d; // 3.14
```

* Calling `a.toString()` is [...] explicit [...] but [...] `toString()` cannot be called on a *primitive* value like `42`. So JS `automatically "boxes"` [...] `42` in an object wrapper, so that `toString()` can be called against the object.

* `+c` here is showing the *unary operator* form (`operator with only one operand`) of the `+` operator. Instead of performing mathematic addition [...] the unary `+` explicitly coerces its operand (`c`) to a `number` value.

* The unary `-` operator also coerces like `+` does, but it also `flips` the sign of the number. However, you `cannot` put two `--` next to each other to unflip the sign, as that's parsed as the `decrement operator`. Instead, you would need to do: `- -"3.14"` [...] result in coercion to `3.14`.

#### `Date` To `number`
* Another common usage of the unary `+` operator is to coerce a `Date` object into a `number`, because the result is the `unix timestamp` (milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC) representation of the date/time value:

```js
var d = new Date( "Mon, 18 Aug 2014 08:53:06 CDT" );

+d; // 1408369986000
```

* A noncoercion approach is perhaps [...] preferable, as it's even more explicit:

```js
var timestamp = new Date().getTime();
// var timestamp = (new Date()).getTime();
// var timestamp = (new Date).getTime();
```

```js
var timestamp = Date.now();
```

#### The Curious Case of the `~`
* `~` operator (aka "`bitwise NOT`"). Many of those who even understand what it does will often times still want to avoid it.

* (WCRL).

##### Truncating Bits
* (WCRL).

### Explicitly: Parsing Numeric Strings
* A similar outcome to coercing a `string` to a `number` can be achieved by parsing a `number` out of a `string`'s character contents. There are, however, distinct differences between this parsing and the type conversion we examined above.

```js
var a = "42";
var b = "42px";

Number( a );	// 42
parseInt( a );	// 42

Number( b );	// NaN
parseInt( b );	// 42
```

* Parsing a numeric value out of a string is *tolerant* of non-numeric characters (me: it just stops parsing **left-to-right** when encountered) whereas coercion is *not tolerant* and fails resulting in the `NaN` value.

* `parseInt(..)` has a twin, `parseFloat(..)`, which [...] pulls out a floating-point number from a string.

* If you pass a non-`string`, the value you pass will automatically be coerced to a `string` first [...] It's a really bad idea to rely upon such a behavior in your program.

* Prior to `ES5`, another gotcha existed with `parseInt(..)`, which was the source of many JS programs' bugs. If you didn't pass a `second argument` to indicate which `numeric base` (aka `radix`) to use for interpreting the numeric `string` contents, `parseInt(..)` would look at `the beginning character(s)` to make a guess.

* If the first two characters were `"0x"` or `"0X"`, the guess [...] was that you wanted to interpret the `string` as a hexadecimal (base-16) `number`. Otherwise, if the first character was `"0"`, the guess [...] was that you wanted to interpret the `string` as an octal (base-8) `number`.

* Hexadecimal `string`s (with the leading `0x` or `0X`) aren't [...] easy to get mixed up. But the `octal number guessing` [...] (me: is) common.

```js
var hour = parseInt( selectedHour.value );
var minute = parseInt( selectedMinute.value );

console.log( "The time you selected was: " + hour + ":" + minute);
```

* Seems harmless, right? Try selecting `08` for the hour and `09` for the minute. You'll get `0:0`. Why? because `neither` `8` nor `9` are valid characters in `octal base-8`.

* **always pass `10` as the second argument**

* `As of ES5`, `parseInt(..)` no longer `guesses octal`. `Unless you say otherwise`, it assumes `base-10` (or base-16 for `"0x"` `prefixes`).

#### Parsing Non-Strings
```js
parseInt( 1/0, 19 ); // 18
```

* `parseInt( 1/0, 19 )` [...] essentially `parseInt( "Infinity", 19 )` [...] The first character is `"I"`, which is value `18` in the silly `base-19`. The second character `"n"` is not in the valid set of numeric characters, and as such the parsing simply `politely stops`, just like when it ran across `"p"` in `"42px"` [...] The result? (me: of the `parseInt` function is) `18`.

* Other examples of this behavior with `parseInt(..)`.

```js
parseInt( 0.000008 );		// 0   ("0" from "0.000008")
parseInt( 0.0000008 );		// 8   ("8" from "8e-7")
parseInt( false, 16 );		// 250 ("fa" from "false")
parseInt( parseInt, 16 );	// 15  ("f" from "function..")

parseInt( "0x10" );			// 16
parseInt( "103", 2 );		// 2
```

### Explicitly: * --> Boolean
* Just like with `String(..)` and `Number(..)` above, `Boolean(..)` (without the `new`, of course!) is an explicit way of forcing the `ToBoolean` coercion:

```js
var a = "0";
var b = [];
var c = {};

var d = "";
var e = 0;
var f = null;
var g;

Boolean( a ); // true
Boolean( b ); // true
Boolean( c ); // true

Boolean( d ); // false
Boolean( e ); // false
Boolean( f ); // false
Boolean( g ); // false
```

* Just like the unary `+` operator coerces a value to a `number` [...] the unary `!` negate operator `explicitly coerces` a value to a `boolean`. The *problem* is that it also `flips` the value from truthy to falsy or vice versa. So, the most common way JS developers explicitly coerce to `boolean` is to use the `!!` double-negate operator.

```js
var a = "0";
var b = [];
var c = {};

var d = "";
var e = 0;
var f = null;
var g;

!!a;	// true
!!b;	// true
!!c;	// true

!!d;	// false
!!e;	// false
!!f;	// false
!!g;	// false
```

* Any of these `ToBoolean` coercions would happen *implicitly* without the `Boolean(..)` or `!!`, if used in a `boolean` context such as an `if (..) ..` statement.

* If you come to JavaScript from Java, you may recognize this idiom:

```js
var a = 42;

var b = a ? true : false;
```

## Implicit Coercion
### Simplifying Implicitly
### Implicitly: Strings <--> Numbers
* The `+` operator is overloaded to serve the purposes of both `number` addition and `string` concatenation. So how does JS know which type of operation you want to use?

```js
var a = "42";
var b = "0";

var c = 42;
var d = 0;

a + b; // "420"
c + d; // 42
```

* It's a common misconception that the difference is whether one or both of the operands is a `string`, as that means `+` will assume `string` concatenation. While that's partially true, it's more complicated than that.

```js
var a = [1,2];
var b = [3,4];

a + b; // "1,23,4"
```

* Neither of these operands is a `string`, but clearly they were both coerced to `string`s and then the `string` concatenation kicked in. So what's really going on?
	* (me: According to ES5 spec section 11.6.1, the `+` algorithm [...] first calls the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation (section 9.1) on (me: `both of the operands`), if an operand is a primitive value (`undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`) the `toPrimitive` operation returns the operand itself, but if an operand is an `object`, then the operation calls the (me: read the `section 8.12.8` for a more detail look at the implemtation of the `[[DefaultValue]]` method as well as its hint)(`[[DefaultValue]]` algorithm with a context `hint` of `number`) then if either the value returned by the `DefaultValue` operation is a string, the `string` concatenation of the 2 `DefaultValue operation-returned values`, now converted to `strings` by the `ToString` method kicks in. `Otherwise`, a `numberic addition`, the addition of the 2 `DefaultValue operation-returned values`, now converted to number by the `ToNumber` method is performed)

	* this operation (me: with the 2 `objects`, indeed 2 `arrays`) is now identical to how the `ToNumber` abstract operation handles `object`s (see the "`ToNumber`"" section earlier). The `valueOf()` operation on the `array` will fail to produce a simple primitive, so it then falls to a `toString()` representation. The two `array`s thus become `"1,2"` and `"3,4"`, respectively. Now, `+` concatenates the two `string`s as you'd normally expect: `"1,23,4"`.

* simplified explanation: if either operand to `+` is a `string` (or becomes one with the `above steps`!), the operation will be `string` concatenation. `Otherwise`, it's `always numeric addition`.

* **Note:** A commonly cited coercion gotcha is `[] + {}` vs. `{} + []`, as those two expressions result, respectively, in `"[object Object]"` and `0`. There's more to it, though, and we cover those details in "Blocks" in `Chapter 5`.

* What's that mean for *implicit* coercion? [...] You can coerce a `number` to a `string` simply by "adding" the `number` and the `""` empty `string`

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a + "";

b; // "42"
```

* Comparing this *implicit* coercion of `a + ""` to our earlier example of `String(a)` *explicit* coercion (me: with `a` returning an `object` only, check the `(me)` section in the example below), there's one additional quirk to be aware of. Because of how the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation works, `a + ""` invokes `valueOf()` on the `a` value, whose return value is then finally converted to a `string` via the internal `ToString` abstract operation. But `String(a)` just invokes `toString()` directly.

* Both approaches ultimately result in a `string`, but if you're using an `object` instead of a regular primitive `number` value, you may not necessarily get the *same* `string` value!

```js
var a = {
	valueOf: function() { return 42; },
	toString: function() { return 4; }
};

a + "";			// "42"

String( a );	// "4"
```

* How can we *implicitly coerce* from `string` to `number`?

```js
var a = "3.14";
var b = a - 0;

b; // 3.14
```

* The `-` operator is defined `only for numeric` subtraction, so `a - 0` forces `a`'s value to be coerced to a `number`. While far less common, `a * 1` or `a / 1` would accomplish the same result, as those operators are also `only defined for numeric operations`.

* What about `object` values with the `-` operator? Similar (me: to how the `toNumber` method works -- see the `ToNumber` section earlier)

```js
var a = [3];
var b = [1];

a - b; // 2
```

* Both `array` values have to become `number`s, but they end up first being coerced to `strings` (using the expected `toString()` serialization), and then are coerced to `number`s.

### Implicitly: Booleans --> Numbers
```js
function onlyOne(a,b,c) {
	return !!((a && !b && !c) ||
		(!a && b && !c) || (!a && !b && c));
}

var a = true;
var b = false;

onlyOne( a, b, b );	// true
onlyOne( b, a, b );	// true

onlyOne( a, b, a );	// false
```

* This `onlyOne(..)` utility should only return `true` if exactly one of the arguments is `true` / truthy [...] But what if we needed that utility to be able to handle [...] twenty flags [...] It's pretty difficult to [...] implementing [...] But here's where coercing the `boolean` values to `number`s (`0` or `1`, obviously) can greatly help:

```js
function onlyOne() {
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
		// skip falsy values. same as treating
		// them as 0's, but avoids NaN's.
		if (arguments[i]) {
			sum += arguments[i];
		}
	}
	return sum == 1;
}

var a = true;
var b = false;

onlyOne( b, a );		// true
onlyOne( b, a, b, b, b );	// true

onlyOne( b, b );		// false
onlyOne( b, a, b, b, b, a );	// false
```

* If one and only one value in the `arguments` list is `true`, then the numeric sum will be `1`, otherwise the sum will not be `1` and thus the desired condition is not met [...] We could of course do this with *explicit* coercion.

```js
function onlyOne() {
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
		sum += Number( !!arguments[i] );
	}
	return sum === 1;
}
```

* `!!arguments[i]` [...] so you could pass non-`boolean` values in [...] and it would still work as expected (otherwise you'd end up with `string` concatenation and the logic would be incorrect).

* you could easily make `onlyTwo(..)` or `onlyFive(..)` variations by simply changing the final comparison from `1`, to `2` or `5`, respectively.

### Implicitly: * --> Boolean
1. The test expression in an `if (..)` statement.
2. The test expression (second clause) in a `for ( .. ; .. ; .. )` header.
3. The test expression in `while (..)` and `do..while(..)` loops.
4. The test expression (first clause) in `? :` ternary expressions.
5. The left-hand operand (which serves as a test expression -- see below!) to the `||` ("logical or") and `&&` ("logical and") operators.

* Any value used in these contexts that is not already a `boolean` will be *implicitly* coerced to a `boolean` using the rules of the `ToBoolean` abstract operation.

### Operators `||` and `&&`
* these operators shouldn't even be called "logical ___ operators" [...] a more accurate (if more clumsy) name, I'd call them "selector operators," or more completely, "operand selector operators." [...] Because they don't actually result in a *logic* value [...] in JavaScript, as [...] in some other languages [...] (me: instead) **they select one of the two operand's values**.

* Both `||` and `&&` operators perform a `boolean` test on the **first operand** [...] If the operand is not already `boolean` [...] a normal `ToBoolean` coercion occurs.

* For the `||` operator, if the test is `true`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *first operand* [...] If the test is `false`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *second operand* [...] `Inversely`, for the `&&` operator.

* `a || b` "roughly equivalent" to `a ? a : b` because the outcome is identical, but there's a nuanced difference. In `a ? a : b`, if `a` was a more complex expression (like for instance one that might have side effects like calling a `function`, etc.), then the `a` expression would possibly be `evaluated twice` (if the first evaluation was truthy). By contrast, for `a || b`, the `a` expression is evaluated only once [...] that value is used both for the coercive test as well as the result value.

* An extremely common and helpful usage of (me: `||`).

```js
function foo(a,b) {
	a = a || "hello";
	b = b || "world";

	console.log( a + " " + b );
}

foo();					// "hello world"
foo( "yeah", "yeah!" );	// "yeah yeah!"
```

* **Be careful**, though!

```js
foo( "That's it!", "" ); // "That's it! world" <-- Oops!
```

* There's another idiom that is quite a bit less commonly [...] this usage is sometimes called the "`guard operator`".

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( a );
}

var a = 42;

a && foo(); // 42
```

* **Note:** Both the `a = b || "something"` and `a && b()` idioms rely on short circuiting behavior, which we cover in more detail in Chapter 5.

* (me: no need an example for this argument) `a && (b || c)` expression *actually* results in `"foo"`, not `true`. So, the `if` statement *then* forces the `"foo"` value to coerce to a `boolean`.

### Symbol Coercion
* `ES6` Symbols introduce a gotcha into the coercion system.

```js
var s1 = Symbol( "cool" );
String( s1 );					// "Symbol(cool)"

var s2 = Symbol( "not cool" );
s2 + "";						// TypeError

// (me)
Number(s2) // TypeError
```

* `symbol` values cannot coerce to `number` at all (throws an error either way), `but strangely` they can both *explicitly* and *implicitly* coerce to `boolean` (always `true`).

## Loose Equals vs. Strict Equals
* `common misconception` [...] "`==` checks values for equality and `===` checks both values and types for equality." [...] The correct description is: "`==` allows coercion in the equality comparison and `===` disallows coercion."

### Equality Performance
* `==` is the one *doing more work* because it has to follow through the steps of `coercion` if the types are different [...] this has [...] to do with performance [...] While it's [...] take *a little bit* of processing time, it's mere microseconds (yes, that's millionths of a second!) [...] If you're comparing two values of the `same types`, `==` and `===` use the identical algorithm.

* **Note:** The implication here then is that both `==` and `===` check the `types` of their operands. The difference is in how they respond if the types don't match.

### Abstract Equality
* The `==` operator's behavior is defined as "The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm" in section 11.9.3 of the ES5 spec.

* the first clause (11.9.3.1) says, if the two values being compared are of the `same type`, they are simply and naturally compared via `Identity` as you'd expect. For example, `42` is only equal to `42`, and `"abc"` is only equal to `"abc"` [...] Some minor exceptions to normal expectation to be aware of:
  * `NaN` is never equal to itself (see Chapter 2)
  * `+0` and `-0` are equal to each other (see Chapter 2)

* The final provision in clause 11.9.3.1 is for `==` loose equality comparison with `object`s (including `function`s and `array`s). Two such values are only *equal* if they are *both references to the exact same value*. `No coercion occurs` here.

* It's a very little known fact that **`==` and `===` behave identically** in the case where two `object`s are being compared!

* The rest of the algorithm in 11.9.3 specifies that if you use `==` loose equality to compare two values of `different types`, `one or both` of the values will need to be *implicitly* coerced. This coercion happens so that both values eventually end up as the same type, which can then directly be compared for equality using simple `value Identity`.

* The `!=` loose not-equality operation is [...] the `==` operation comparison performed in its entirety, then the `negation` of the result. The same goes for the `!==` strict not-equality operation.

#### Comparing: `string`s to `number`s
```js
var a = 42;
var b = "42";

a === b;	// false
a == b;		// true
```

* `a === b` fails, because `no coercion` is allowed, and [...] the `42` and `"42"` values are different.

* the second comparison `a == b` uses loose equality, which means that `if the types happen to be different`, the comparison algorithm will perform *implicit* coercion on one or both values [...] But [...] Does the `a` value of `42` become a `string`, or does the `b` value of `"42"` become a `number`? [...] In the ES5 spec, clauses 11.9.3.4-5 say:
	> 4. If Type(x) is Number and Type(y) is String,
	>    return the result of the comparison x == ToNumber(y).
	> 5. If Type(x) is String and Type(y) is Number,
	>    return the result of the comparison ToNumber(x) == y.

* **Warning:** The spec uses `Number` and `String` as the formal names for the types, while this book prefers `number` and `string` for the primitive types. Do not let the capitalization of `Number` in the spec confuse you for the `Number()` native function.

#### Comparing: anything to `boolean`
* Let's again quote the spec, clauses 11.9.3.6-7:
	> 6. If Type(x) is Boolean,
	>    return the result of the comparison ToNumber(x) == y.
	> 7. If Type(y) is Boolean,
	>    return the result of the comparison x == ToNumber(y).

```js
var x = true;
var y = "42";

x == y; // false
```

* The `Type(x)` is indeed `Boolean`, so it performs `ToNumber(x)`, which coerces `true` to `1`. Now, `1 == "42"` is evaluated. The types are still different, so (essentially recursively) we reconsult the algorithm, which just as above will coerce `"42"` to `42`, and `1 == 42` is clearly `false`.

* `"42"` is indeed `truthy`, but `"42" == true` **is not performing a boolean test/coercion** [...] `"42"` *is not* being coerced to a `boolean` (`true`), but instead `true` is being coerced to a `1`, and then `"42"` is being coerced to `42`.

* `=== true` and `=== false` wouldn't allow the coercion, so they're safe from this hidden `ToNumber` coercion.

```js
var a = "42";

// bad (will fail!):
if (a == true) {
	// ..
}

// also bad (will fail!):
if (a === true) {
	// ..
}

// good enough (works implicitly):
if (a) {
	// ..
}

// better (works explicitly):
if (!!a) {
	// ..
}

// also great (works explicitly):
if (Boolean( a )) {
	// ..
}
```

* avoid ever using `== true` or `== false` [...] (me: and) you'll never have to worry about this truthiness/falsiness mental gotcha.

#### Comparing: `null`s to `undefined`s
* again quoting the ES5 spec, clauses 11.9.3.2-3:
	> 2. If x is null and y is undefined, return true.
	> 3. If x is undefined and y is null, return true.

```js
var a = doSomething();

if (a == null) {
	// ..
}
```

* The `a == null` check will pass only if `doSomething()` returns `either` `null` or `undefined`.

#### Comparing: `object`s to non-`object`s
* If an `object`/`function`/`array` is compared to a simple [...] primitive (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`), the ES5 spec says in clauses 11.9.3.8-9:
	> 8. If Type(x) is either String or Number and Type(y) is Object,
	>    return the result of the comparison x == ToPrimitive(y).
	> 9. If Type(x) is Object and Type(y) is either String or Number,
	>    return the result of the comparison ToPrimitive(x) == y.

* **Note:** You may notice that these clauses only mention `String` and `Number`, but not `Boolean`. That's because, as quoted earlier, clauses 11.9.3.6-7 take care of coercing any `Boolean` operand presented to a `Number` first.

* **Tip:** All the quirks of the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation that we discussed earlier in this chapter (`toString()`, `valueOf()`) apply here as you'd expect. This can be quite useful if you have a complex data structure that you want to define a custom `valueOf()` method on, to provide a simple value for equality comparison purposes.

```js
var a = "abc";
var b = Object( a );	// same as `new String( a )` (me: read more in the Chapter 3 - unboxing section)

a === b;				// false
a == b;					// true
```

* `a == b` is `true` because `b` is coerced (aka "unboxed," unwrapped) via `ToPrimitive` to its underlying `"abc"` simple [...] primitive value, which is the same as the value in `a` [...] There are some values where this is `not the case`.

```js
var a = null;
var b = Object( a );	// same as `Object()`
a == b;					// false

var c = undefined;
var d = Object( c );	// same as `Object()`
c == d;					// false

var e = NaN;
var f = Object( e );	// same as `new Number( e )`
e == f;					// false
```

* The `null` and `undefined` values `cannot be boxed` -- they have no object wrapper equivalent -- so `Object(null)` is just like `Object()` in that both just produce a normal object.

* `NaN` can be boxed to its `Number` object wrapper equivalent, but [...] the `NaN == NaN` comparison fails because `NaN` is never equal to itself (see Chapter 2).

### Edge Cases
#### A Number By Any Other Value Would...
```js
Number.prototype.valueOf = function() {
	return 3;
};

new Number( 2 ) == 3;	// true
```

* **Warning:** `2 == 3` would not have fallen into this trap, because neither `2` nor `3` would have invoked the built-in `Number.prototype.valueOf()` method because both are already primitive `number` values and can be compared `directly`. However, `new Number(2)` must go through the `ToPrimitive` coercion, and thus invoke `valueOf()`.

* Next, let's consider another tricky example.

```js
if (a == 2 && a == 3) {
	// ..
}
```

* You might think this would be impossible [...] (me: but you are wrong) since the first expression `a == 2` happens strictly *before* `a == 3` [...] So, what if we make `a.valueOf()` have `side effects` each time it's called, such that the first time it returns `2` and the second time it's called it returns `3`? Pretty easy:

```js
var i = 2;

Number.prototype.valueOf = function() {
	return i++;
};

var a = new Number( 42 );

if (a == 2 && a == 3) {
	console.log( "Yep, this happened." );
}
```

#### False-y Comparisons
* The most common complaint against *implicit* coercion in `==` comparisons comes from how `falsy values` behave surprisingly when compared to each other.

```js
"0" == null;			// false
"0" == undefined;		// false
"0" == false;			// true -- UH OH! (me: false is converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method. "0" is then also converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
"0" == NaN;				// false
"0" == 0;				// true (me: "0" is converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
"0" == "";				// false

false == null;			// false
false == undefined;		// false
false == NaN;			// false
false == 0;				// true -- UH OH! (me: false is converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
false == "";			// true -- UH OH! (me: false is converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method, "" is then also converted 0 by the method)
false == [];			// true -- UH OH! (me: false is converted to 0 by the `toNumber method`, [] is then converted to "" by the `toPrimitive` method & then converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
false == {};			// false

"" == null;				// false
"" == undefined;		// false
"" == NaN;				// false
"" == 0;				// true -- UH OH! (me: "" is converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
"" == [];				// true -- UH OH! (me: [] is converted to "" by the `toPrimive` method)
"" == {};				// false

0 == null;				// false
0 == undefined;			// false
0 == NaN;				// false
0 == [];				// true -- UH OH! (me: [] is converted to "" by the `toPrimive` method & then converted to 0 by the `toNumber` method)
0 == {};				// false
```

#### The Crazy Ones
```js
[] == ![];		// true
```

* What do we know about the `!` unary operator? It `explicitly coerces` to a `boolean` using the `ToBoolean` rules (and it also `flips` the parity). So **before** `[] == ![]` is even processed, it's actually already translated to `[] == false`. We already saw that form in our above list (`false == []`), so its surprise result is *not new* to us.

* Another famously cited gotcha:

```js
0 == "\n";		// true
```

* empty `""`, `"\n"` (or `" "` or any other whitespace combination) is coerced via `ToNumber`, and the result is `0`. What other `number` value would you expect whitespace to coerce to? Does it bother you that *explicit* `Number(" ")` yields `0`?

#### Sanity Check
#### Safely Using Implicit Coercion
## Abstract Relational Comparison
* The "Abstract Relational Comparison" algorithm in ES5 section 11.8.5 essentially divides itself into two parts: what to do if the comparison involves both `string` values (second half), or anything else (first half).

* **Note:** The algorithm is only defined for `a < b`. So, `a > b` is handled as `b < a`.

* The algorithm first calls `ToPrimitive` coercion on `both values`, and if the return result of `either` call is `not a string`, then `both values` are coerced to `number` values using the `ToNumber` operation rules, and compared `numerically`.

```js
var a = [ 42 ];
var b = [ "43" ];

a < b;	// true
b < a;	// false
```

* Similar caveats for `-0` and `NaN` apply here as they did in the `==` algorithm discussed earlier.

* `However`, (me: after the `toPrimitive` operation is done) if `both values` are `string`s for the `<` comparison, simple lexicographic (`natural alphabetic`) comparison on the characters is performed:

```js
var a = [ "42" ];
var b = [ "043" ];

a < b;	// false
```

* `a` and `b` are *not* coerced to `number`s, because `both` of them `end up` as `string`s `after` the `ToPrimitive` coercion on the two `array`s. So, `"42"` is compared character by character to `"043"`, starting with the first characters `"4"` and `"0"`, respectively. Since `"0"` is lexicographically *less than* than `"4"`, the comparison returns `false`.

* What about:

```js
var a = { b: 42 };
var b = { b: 43 };

a < b;	// ??
```

* `a < b` is also `false`, because `a` becomes `[object Object]` and `b` becomes `[object Object]`, and so clearly `a` is not lexicographically less than `b` [...] But strangely:

```js
var a = { b: 42 };
var b = { b: 43 };

a < b;	// false
a == b;	// false
a > b;	// false

a <= b;	// true
a >= b;	// true
```

* Why is `a == b` not `true`? They're the same `string` value (`"[object Object]"`) [...] Recall the previous discussion about how `==` works with `object references`.

* But then how are `a <= b` and `a >= b` resulting in `true`, if `a < b` **and** `a == b` **and** `a > b` are all `false`? [...] Because the spec says for `a <= b`, it will actually evaluate `b < a` first, and then `negate` that result. Since `b < a` is *also* `false`, the result of `a <= b` is `true`.

* That's probably awfully contrary to how you might have explained what `<=` does [...] which would likely have been [...]: "less than *or* equal to." `JS` more accurately considers `<=` as "`not greater than`" (`!(a > b)`, which JS treats as `!(b < a)` (me: recall the previous argument: **`a > b` is handled as `b < a`**)). Moreover, `a >= b` is explained by `first considering` it as `b <= a`, and then applying the same (me: the explaination above in this argument)(reasoning).

* `Unfortunately`, there is `no "strict relational comparison"` [...] no way to prevent *implicit* coercion from occurring with relational comparisons like `a < b`.

## Review

# Chapter 5: Grammar
* **Note:** The term "grammar" may be a little less familiar to readers than the term "syntax." In many ways, they are similar terms, describing the *rules* for how the language works.

## Statements & Expressions
It's fairly common for developers to assume that the term "statement" and "expression" are roughly equivalent. But here we need to distinguish between the two, because there are some very important differences in our JS programs.

To draw the distinction, let's borrow from terminology you may be more familiar with: the English language.

A "sentence" is one complete formation of words that expresses a thought. It's comprised of one or more "phrases," each of which can be connected with punctuation marks or conjunction words ("and," "or," etc). A phrase can itself be made up of smaller phrases. Some phrases are incomplete and don't accomplish much by themselves, while other phrases can stand on their own. These rules are collectively called the *grammar* of the English language.

And so it goes with JavaScript grammar. Statements are sentences, expressions are phrases, and operators are conjunctions/punctuation.

Every expression in JS can be evaluated down to a single, specific value result. For example:

```js
var a = 3 * 6;
var b = a;
b;
```

In this snippet, `3 * 6` is an expression (evaluates to the value `18`). But `a` on the second line is also an expression, as is `b` on the third line. The `a` and `b` expressions both evaluate to the values stored in those variables at that moment, which also happens to be `18`.

Moreover, each of the three lines is a statement containing expressions. `var a = 3 * 6` and `var b = a` are called "declaration statements" because they each declare a variable (and optionally assign a value to it). The `a = 3 * 6` and `b = a` assignments (minus the `var`s) are called assignment expressions.

The third line contains just the expression `b`, but it's also a statement all by itself (though not a terribly interesting one!). This is generally referred to as an "expression statement."

### Statement Completion Values

It's a fairly little known fact that statements all have completion values (even if that value is just `undefined`).

How would you even go about seeing the completion value of a statement?

The most obvious answer is to type the statement into your browser's developer console, because when you execute it, the console by default reports the completion value of the most recent statement it executed.

Let's consider `var b = a`. What's the completion value of that statement?

The `b = a` assignment expression results in the value that was assigned (`18` above), but the `var` statement itself results in `undefined`. Why? Because `var` statements are defined that way in the spec. If you put `var a = 42;` into your console, you'll see `undefined` reported back instead of `42`.

**Note:** Technically, it's a little more complex than that. In the ES5 spec, section 12.2 "Variable Statement," the `VariableDeclaration` algorithm actually *does* return a value (a `string` containing the name of the variable declared -- weird, huh!?), but that value is basically swallowed up (except for use by the `for..in` loop) by the `VariableStatement` algorithm, which forces an empty (aka `undefined`) completion value.

In fact, if you've done much code experimenting in your console (or in a JavaScript environment REPL -- read/evaluate/print/loop tool), you've probably seen `undefined` reported after many different statements, and perhaps never realized why or what that was. Put simply, the console is just reporting the statement's completion value.

But what the console prints out for the completion value isn't something we can use inside our program. So how can we capture the completion value?

That's a much more complicated task. Before we explain *how*, let's explore *why* you would want to do that.

We need to consider other types of statement completion values. For example, any regular `{ .. }` block has a completion value of the completion value of its last contained statement/expression.

Consider:

```js
var b;

if (true) {
	b = 4 + 38;
}
```

If you typed that into your console/REPL, you'd probably see `42` reported, since `42` is the completion value of the `if` block, which took on the completion value of its last assignment expression statement `b = 4 + 38`.

In other words, the completion value of a block is like an *implicit return* of the last statement value in the block.

**Note:** This is conceptually familiar in languages like CoffeeScript, which have implicit `return` values from `function`s that are the same as the last statement value in the function.

But there's an obvious problem. This kind of code doesn't work:

```js
var a, b;

a = if (true) {
	b = 4 + 38;
};
```

We can't capture the completion value of a statement and assign it into another variable in any easy syntactic/grammatical way (at least not yet!).

So, what can we do?

**Warning**: For demo purposes only -- don't actually do the following in your real code!

We could use the much maligned `eval(..)` (sometimes pronounced "evil") function to capture this completion value.

```js
var a, b;

a = eval( "if (true) { b = 4 + 38; }" );

a;	// 42
```

Yeeeaaahhhh. That's terribly ugly. But it works! And it illustrates the point that statement completion values are a real thing that can be captured not just in our console but in our programs.

There's a proposal for ES7 called "do expression." Here's how it might work:

```js
var a, b;

a = do {
	if (true) {
		b = 4 + 38;
	}
};

a;	// 42
```

The `do { .. }` expression executes a block (with one or many statements in it), and the final statement completion value inside the block becomes the completion value *of* the `do` expression, which can then be assigned to `a` as shown.

The general idea is to be able to treat statements as expressions -- they can show up inside other statements -- without needing to wrap them in an inline function expression and perform an explicit `return ..`.

For now, statement completion values are not much more than trivia. But they're probably going to take on more significance as JS evolves, and hopefully `do { .. }` expressions will reduce the temptation to use stuff like `eval(..)`.

**Warning:** Repeating my earlier admonition: avoid `eval(..)`. Seriously. See the *Scope & Closures* title of this series for more explanation.

### Expression Side Effects

Most expressions don't have side effects. For example:

```js
var a = 2;
var b = a + 3;
```

The expression `a + 3` did not *itself* have a side effect, like for instance changing `a`. It had a result, which is `5`, and that result was assigned to `b` in the statement `b = a + 3`.

The most common example of an expression with (possible) side effects is a function call expression:

```js
function foo() {
	a = a + 1;
}

var a = 1;
foo();		// result: `undefined`, side effect: changed `a`
```

There are other side-effecting expressions, though. For example:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a++;
```

The expression `a++` has two separate behaviors. *First*, it returns the current value of `a`, which is `42` (which then gets assigned to `b`). But *next*, it changes the value of `a` itself, incrementing it by one.

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a++;

a;	// 43
b;	// 42
```

Many developers would mistakenly believe that `b` has value `43` just like `a` does. But the confusion comes from not fully considering the *when* of the side effects of the `++` operator.

The `++` increment operator and the `--` decrement operator are both unary operators (see Chapter 4), which can be used in either a postfix ("after") position or prefix ("before") position.

```js
var a = 42;

a++;	// 42
a;		// 43

++a;	// 44
a;		// 44
```

When `++` is used in the prefix position as `++a`, its side effect (incrementing `a`) happens *before* the value is returned from the expression, rather than *after* as with `a++`.

**Note:** Would you think `++a++` was legal syntax? If you try it, you'll get a `ReferenceError` error, but why? Because side-effecting operators **require a variable reference** to target their side effects to. For `++a++`, the `a++` part is evaluated first (because of operator precedence -- see below), which gives back the value of `a` _before_ the increment. But then it tries to evaluate `++42`, which (if you try it) gives the same `ReferenceError` error, since `++` can't have a side effect directly on a value like `42`.

It is sometimes mistakenly thought that you can encapsulate the *after* side effect of `a++` by wrapping it in a `( )` pair, like:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = (a++);

a;	// 43
b;	// 42
```

Unfortunately, `( )` itself doesn't define a new wrapped expression that would be evaluated *after* the *after side effect* of the `a++` expression, as we might have hoped. In fact, even if it did, `a++` returns `42` first, and unless you have another expression that reevaluates `a` after the side effect of `++`, you're not going to get `43` from that expression, so `b` will not be assigned `43`.

There's an option, though: the `,` statement-series comma operator. This operator allows you to string together multiple standalone expression statements into a single statement:

```js
var a = 42, b;
b = ( a++, a );

a;	// 43
b;	// 43
```

**Note:** The `( .. )` around `a++, a` is required here. The reason is operator precedence, which we'll cover later in this chapter.

The expression `a++, a` means that the second `a` statement expression gets evaluated *after* the *after side effects* of the first `a++` statement expression, which means it returns the `43` value for assignment to `b`.

Another example of a side-effecting operator is `delete`. As we showed in Chapter 2, `delete` is used to remove a property from an `object` or a slot from an `array`. But it's usually just called as a standalone statement:

```js
var obj = {
	a: 42
};

obj.a;			// 42
delete obj.a;	// true
obj.a;			// undefined
```

The result value of the `delete` operator is `true` if the requested operation is valid/allowable, or `false` otherwise. But the side effect of the operator is that it removes the property (or array slot).

**Note:** What do we mean by valid/allowable? Nonexistent properties, or properties that exist and are configurable (see Chapter 3 of the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series) will return `true` from the `delete` operator. Otherwise, the result will be `false` or an error.

One last example of a side-effecting operator, which may at once be both obvious and nonobvious, is the `=` assignment operator.

Consider:

```js
var a;

a = 42;		// 42
a;			// 42
```

It may not seem like `=` in `a = 42` is a side-effecting operator for the expression. But if we examine the result value of the `a = 42` statement, it's the value that was just assigned (`42`), so the assignment of that same value into `a` is essentially a side effect.

**Tip:** The same reasoning about side effects goes for the compound-assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, etc. For example, `a = b += 2` is processed first as `b += 2` (which is `b = b + 2`), and the result of *that* `=` assignment is then assigned to `a`.

This behavior that an assignment expression (or statement) results in the assigned value is primarily useful for chained assignments, such as:

```js
var a, b, c;

a = b = c = 42;
```

Here, `c = 42` is evaluated to `42` (with the side effect of assigning `42` to `c`), then `b = 42` is evaluated to `42` (with the side effect of assigning `42` to `b`), and finally `a = 42` is evaluated (with the side effect of assigning `42` to `a`).

**Warning:** A common mistake developers make with chained assignments is like `var a = b = 42`. While this looks like the same thing, it's not. If that statement were to happen without there also being a separate `var b` (somewhere in the scope) to formally declare `b`, then `var a = b = 42` would not declare `b` directly. Depending on `strict` mode, that would either throw an error or create an accidental global (see the *Scope & Closures* title of this series).

Another scenario to consider:

```js
function vowels(str) {
	var matches;

	if (str) {
		// pull out all the vowels
		matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g );

		if (matches) {
			return matches;
		}
	}
}

vowels( "Hello World" ); // ["e","o","o"]
```

This works, and many developers prefer such. But using an idiom where we take advantage of the assignment side effect, we can simplify by combining the two `if` statements into one:

```js
function vowels(str) {
	var matches;

	// pull out all the vowels
	if (str && (matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g ))) {
		return matches;
	}
}

vowels( "Hello World" ); // ["e","o","o"]
```

**Note:** The `( .. )` around `matches = str.match..` is required. The reason is operator precedence, which we'll cover in the "Operator Precedence" section later in this chapter.

I prefer this shorter style, as I think it makes it clearer that the two conditionals are in fact related rather than separate. But as with most stylistic choices in JS, it's purely opinion which one is *better*.

### Contextual Rules

There are quite a few places in the JavaScript grammar rules where the same syntax means different things depending on where/how it's used. This kind of thing can, in isolation, cause quite a bit of confusion.

We won't exhaustively list all such cases here, but just call out a few of the common ones.

#### `{ .. }` Curly Braces

There's two main places (and more coming as JS evolves!) that a pair of `{ .. }` curly braces will show up in your code. Let's take a look at each of them.

##### Object Literals

First, as an `object` literal:

```js
// assume there's a `bar()` function defined

var a = {
	foo: bar()
};
```

How do we know this is an `object` literal? Because the `{ .. }` pair is a value that's getting assigned to `a`.

**Note:** The `a` reference is called an "l-value" (aka left-hand value) since it's the target of an assignment. The `{ .. }` pair is an "r-value" (aka right-hand value) since it's used *just* as a value (in this case as the source of an assignment).

##### Labels

What happens if we remove the `var a =` part of the above snippet?

```js
// assume there's a `bar()` function defined

{
	foo: bar()
}
```

A lot of developers assume that the `{ .. }` pair is just a standalone `object` literal that doesn't get assigned anywhere. But it's actually entirely different.

Here, `{ .. }` is just a regular code block. It's not very idiomatic in JavaScript (much more so in other languages!) to have a standalone `{ .. }` block like that, but it's perfectly valid JS grammar. It can be especially helpful when combined with `let` block-scoping declarations (see the *Scope & Closures* title in this series).

The `{ .. }` code block here is functionally pretty much identical to the code block being attached to some statement, like a `for`/`while` loop, `if` conditional, etc.

But if it's a normal block of code, what's that bizarre looking `foo: bar()` syntax, and how is that legal?

It's because of a little known (and, frankly, discouraged) feature in JavaScript called "labeled statements." `foo` is a label for the statement `bar()` (which has omitted its trailing `;` -- see "Automatic Semicolons" later in this chapter). But what's the point of a labeled statement?

If JavaScript had a `goto` statement, you'd theoretically be able to say `goto foo` and have execution jump to that location in code. `goto`s are usually considered terrible coding idioms as they make code much harder to understand (aka "spaghetti code"), so it's a *very good thing* that JavaScript doesn't have a general `goto`.

However, JS *does* support a limited, special form of `goto`: labeled jumps. Both the `continue` and `break` statements can optionally accept a specified label, in which case the program flow "jumps" kind of like a `goto`. Consider:

```js
// `foo` labeled-loop
foo: for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {
	for (var j=0; j<4; j++) {
		// whenever the loops meet, continue outer loop
		if (j == i) {
			// jump to the next iteration of
			// the `foo` labeled-loop
			continue foo;
		}

		// skip odd multiples
		if ((j * i) % 2 == 1) {
			// normal (non-labeled) `continue` of inner loop
			continue;
		}

		console.log( i, j );
	}
}
// 1 0
// 2 0
// 2 1
// 3 0
// 3 2
```

**Note:** `continue foo` does not mean "go to the 'foo' labeled position to continue", but rather, "continue the loop that is labeled 'foo' with its next iteration." So, it's not *really* an arbitrary `goto`.

As you can see, we skipped over the odd-multiple `3 1` iteration, but the labeled-loop jump also skipped iterations `1 1` and `2 2`.

Perhaps a slightly more useful form of the labeled jump is with `break __` from inside an inner loop where you want to break out of the outer loop. Without a labeled `break`, this same logic could sometimes be rather awkward to write:

```js
// `foo` labeled-loop
foo: for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {
	for (var j=0; j<4; j++) {
		if ((i * j) >= 3) {
			console.log( "stopping!", i, j );
			// break out of the `foo` labeled loop
			break foo;
		}

		console.log( i, j );
	}
}
// 0 0
// 0 1
// 0 2
// 0 3
// 1 0
// 1 1
// 1 2
// stopping! 1 3
```

**Note:** `break foo` does not mean "go to the 'foo' labeled position to continue," but rather, "break out of the loop/block that is labeled 'foo' and continue *after* it." Not exactly a `goto` in the traditional sense, huh?

The nonlabeled `break` alternative to the above would probably need to involve one or more functions, shared scope variable access, etc. It would quite likely be more confusing than labeled `break`, so here using a labeled `break` is perhaps the better option.

A label can apply to a non-loop block, but only `break` can reference such a non-loop label. You can do a labeled `break ___` out of any labeled block, but you cannot `continue ___` a non-loop label, nor can you do a non-labeled `break` out of a block.

```js
function foo() {
	// `bar` labeled-block
	bar: {
		console.log( "Hello" );
		break bar;
		console.log( "never runs" );
	}
	console.log( "World" );
}

foo();
// Hello
// World
```

Labeled loops/blocks are extremely uncommon, and often frowned upon. It's best to avoid them if possible; for example using function calls instead of the loop jumps. But there are perhaps some limited cases where they might be useful. If you're going to use a labeled jump, make sure to document what you're doing with plenty of comments!

It's a very common belief that JSON is a proper subset of JS, so a string of JSON (like `{"a":42}` -- notice the quotes around the property name as JSON requires!) is thought to be a valid JavaScript program. **Not true!** Try putting `{"a":42}` into your JS console, and you'll get an error.

That's because statement labels cannot have quotes around them, so `"a"` is not a valid label, and thus `:` can't come right after it.

So, JSON is truly a subset of JS syntax, but JSON is not valid JS grammar by itself.

One extremely common misconception along these lines is that if you were to load a JS file into a `<script src=..>` tag that only has JSON content in it (like from an API call), the data would be read as valid JavaScript but just be inaccessible to the program. JSON-P (the practice of wrapping the JSON data in a function call, like `foo({"a":42})`) is usually said to solve this inaccessibility by sending the value to one of your program's functions.

**Not true!** The totally valid JSON value `{"a":42}` by itself would actually throw a JS error because it'd be interpreted as a statement block with an invalid label. But `foo({"a":42})` is valid JS because in it, `{"a":42}` is an `object` literal value being passed to `foo(..)`. So, properly said, **JSON-P makes JSON into valid JS grammar!**

##### Blocks

Another commonly cited JS gotcha (related to coercion -- see Chapter 4) is:

```js
[] + {}; // "[object Object]"
{} + []; // 0
```

This seems to imply the `+` operator gives different results depending on whether the first operand is the `[]` or the `{}`. But that actually has nothing to do with it!

On the first line, `{}` appears in the `+` operator's expression, and is therefore interpreted as an actual value (an empty `object`). Chapter 4 explained that `[]` is coerced to `""` and thus `{}` is coerced to a `string` value as well: `"[object Object]"`.

But on the second line, `{}` is interpreted as a standalone `{}` empty block (which does nothing). Blocks don't need semicolons to terminate them, so the lack of one here isn't a problem. Finally, `+ []` is an expression that *explicitly coerces* (see Chapter 4) the `[]` to a `number`, which is the `0` value.

##### Object Destructuring

Starting with ES6, another place that you'll see `{ .. }` pairs showing up is with "destructuring assignments" (see the *ES6 & Beyond* title of this series for more info), specifically `object` destructuring. Consider:

```js
function getData() {
	// ..
	return {
		a: 42,
		b: "foo"
	};
}

var { a, b } = getData();

console.log( a, b ); // 42 "foo"
```

As you can probably tell, `var { a , b } = ..` is a form of ES6 destructuring assignment, which is roughly equivalent to:

```js
var res = getData();
var a = res.a;
var b = res.b;
```

**Note:** `{ a, b }` is actually ES6 destructuring shorthand for `{ a: a, b: b }`, so either will work, but it's expected that the shorter `{ a, b }` will become the preferred form.

Object destructuring with a `{ .. }` pair can also be used for named function arguments, which is sugar for this same sort of implicit object property assignment:

```js
function foo({ a, b, c }) {
	// no need for:
	// var a = obj.a, b = obj.b, c = obj.c
	console.log( a, b, c );
}

foo( {
	c: [1,2,3],
	a: 42,
	b: "foo"
} );	// 42 "foo" [1, 2, 3]
```

So, the context we use `{ .. }` pairs in entirely determines what they mean, which illustrates the difference between syntax and grammar. It's very important to understand these nuances to avoid unexpected interpretations by the JS engine.

#### `else if` And Optional Blocks

It's a common misconception that JavaScript has an `else if` clause, because you can do:

```js
if (a) {
	// ..
}
else if (b) {
	// ..
}
else {
	// ..
}
```

But there's a hidden characteristic of the JS grammar here: there is no `else if`. But `if` and `else` statements are allowed to omit the `{ }` around their attached block if they only contain a single statement. You've seen this many times before, undoubtedly:

```js
if (a) doSomething( a );
```

Many JS style guides will insist that you always use `{ }` around a single statement block, like:

```js
if (a) { doSomething( a ); }
```

However, the exact same grammar rule applies to the `else` clause, so the `else if` form you've likely always coded is *actually* parsed as:

```js
if (a) {
	// ..
}
else {
	if (b) {
		// ..
	}
	else {
		// ..
	}
}
```

The `if (b) { .. } else { .. }` is a single statement that follows the `else`, so you can either put the surrounding `{ }` in or not. In other words, when you use `else if`, you're technically breaking that common style guide rule and just defining your `else` with a single `if` statement.

Of course, the `else if` idiom is extremely common and results in one less level of indentation, so it's attractive. Whichever way you do it, just call out explicitly in your own style guide/rules and don't assume things like `else if` are direct grammar rules.

## Operator Precedence

As we covered in Chapter 4, JavaScript's version of `&&` and `||` are interesting in that they select and return one of their operands, rather than just resulting in `true` or `false`. That's easy to reason about if there are only two operands and one operator.

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";

a && b;	// "foo"
a || b;	// 42
```

But what about when there's two operators involved, and three operands?

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";
var c = [1,2,3];

a && b || c; // ???
a || b && c; // ???
```

To understand what those expressions result in, we're going to need to understand what rules govern how the operators are processed when there's more than one present in an expression.

These rules are called "operator precedence."

I bet most readers feel they have a decent grasp on operator precedence. But as with everything else we've covered in this book series, we're going to poke and prod at that understanding to see just how solid it really is, and hopefully learn a few new things along the way.

Recall the example from above:

```js
var a = 42, b;
b = ( a++, a );

a;	// 43
b;	// 43
```

But what would happen if we remove the `( )`?

```js
var a = 42, b;
b = a++, a;

a;	// 43
b;	// 42
```

Wait! Why did that change the value assigned to `b`?

Because the `,` operator has a lower precedence than the `=` operator. So, `b = a++, a` is interpreted as `(b = a++), a`. Because (as we explained earlier) `a++` has *after side effects*, the assigned value to `b` is the value `42` before the `++` changes `a`.

This is just a simple matter of needing to understand operator precedence. If you're going to use `,` as a statement-series operator, it's important to know that it actually has the lowest precedence. Every other operator will more tightly bind than `,` will.

Now, recall this example from above:

```js
if (str && (matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g ))) {
	// ..
}
```

We said the `( )` around the assignment is required, but why? Because `&&` has higher precedence than `=`, so without the `( )` to force the binding, the expression would instead be treated as `(str && matches) = str.match..`. But this would be an error, because the result of `(str && matches)` isn't going to be a variable, but instead a value (in this case `undefined`), and so it can't be the left-hand side of an `=` assignment!

OK, so you probably think you've got this operator precedence thing down.

Let's move on to a more complex example (which we'll carry throughout the next several sections of this chapter) to *really* test your understanding:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";
var c = false;

var d = a && b || c ? c || b ? a : c && b : a;

d;		// ??
```

OK, evil, I admit it. No one would write a string of expressions like that, right? *Probably* not, but we're going to use it to examine various issues around chaining multiple operators together, which *is* a very common task.

The result above is `42`. But that's not nearly as interesting as how we can figure out that answer without just plugging it into a JS program to let JavaScript sort it out.

Let's dig in.

The first question -- it may not have even occurred to you to ask -- is, does the first part (`a && b || c`) behave like `(a && b) || c` or like `a && (b || c)`? Do you know for certain? Can you even convince yourself they are actually different?

```js
(false && true) || true;	// true
false && (true || true);	// false
```

So, there's proof they're different. But still, how does `false && true || true` behave? The answer:

```js
false && true || true;		// true
(false && true) || true;	// true
```

So we have our answer. The `&&` operator is evaluated first and the `||` operator is evaluated second.

But is that just because of left-to-right processing? Let's reverse the order of operators:

```js
true || false && false;		// true

(true || false) && false;	// false -- nope
true || (false && false);	// true -- winner, winner!
```

Now we've proved that `&&` is evaluated first and then `||`, and in this case that was actually counter to generally expected left-to-right processing.

So what caused the behavior? **Operator precedence**.

Every language defines its own operator precedence list. It's dismaying, though, just how uncommon it is that JS developers have read JS's list.

If you knew it well, the above examples wouldn't have tripped you up in the slightest, because you'd already know that `&&` is more precedent than `||`. But I bet a fair amount of readers had to think about it a little bit.

**Note:** Unfortunately, the JS spec doesn't really have its operator precedence list in a convenient, single location. You have to parse through and understand all the grammar rules. So we'll try to lay out the more common and useful bits here in a more convenient format. For a complete list of operator precedence, see "Operator Precedence" on the MDN site (* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

### Short Circuited

In Chapter 4, we mentioned in a side note the "short circuiting" nature of operators like `&&` and `||`. Let's revisit that in more detail now.

For both `&&` and `||` operators, the right-hand operand will **not be evaluated** if the left-hand operand is sufficient to determine the outcome of the operation. Hence, the name "short circuited" (in that if possible, it will take an early shortcut out).

For example, with `a && b`, `b` is not evaluated if `a` is falsy, because the result of the `&&` operand is already certain, so there's no point in bothering to check `b`. Likewise, with `a || b`, if `a` is truthy, the result of the operand is already certain, so there's no reason to check `b`.

This short circuiting can be very helpful and is commonly used:

```js
function doSomething(opts) {
	if (opts && opts.cool) {
		// ..
	}
}
```

The `opts` part of the `opts && opts.cool` test acts as sort of a guard, because if `opts` is unset (or is not an `object`), the expression `opts.cool` would throw an error. The `opts` test failing plus the short circuiting means that `opts.cool` won't even be evaluated, thus no error!

Similarly, you can use `||` short circuiting:

```js
function doSomething(opts) {
	if (opts.cache || primeCache()) {
		// ..
	}
}
```

Here, we're checking for `opts.cache` first, and if it's present, we don't call the `primeCache()` function, thus avoiding potentially unnecessary work.

### Tighter Binding

But let's turn our attention back to that earlier complex statement example with all the chained operators, specifically the `? :` ternary operator parts. Does the `? :` operator have more or less precedence than the `&&` and `||` operators?

```js
a && b || c ? c || b ? a : c && b : a
```

Is that more like this:

```js
a && b || (c ? c || (b ? a : c) && b : a)
```

or this?

```js
(a && b || c) ? (c || b) ? a : (c && b) : a
```

The answer is the second one. But why?

Because `&&` is more precedent than `||`, and `||` is more precedent than `? :`.

So, the expression `(a && b || c)` is evaluated *first* before the `? :` it participates in. Another way this is commonly explained is that `&&` and `||` "bind more tightly" than `? :`. If the reverse was true, then `c ? c...` would bind more tightly, and it would behave (as the first choice) like `a && b || (c ? c..)`.

### Associativity

So, the `&&` and `||` operators bind first, then the `? :` operator. But what about multiple operators of the same precedence? Do they always process left-to-right or right-to-left?

In general, operators are either left-associative or right-associative, referring to whether **grouping happens from the left or from the right**.

It's important to note that associativity is *not* the same thing as left-to-right or right-to-left processing.

But why does it matter whether processing is left-to-right or right-to-left? Because expressions can have side effects, like for instance with function calls:

```js
var a = foo() && bar();
```

Here, `foo()` is evaluated first, and then possibly `bar()` depending on the result of the `foo()` expression. That definitely could result in different program behavior than if `bar()` was called before `foo()`.

But this behavior is *just* left-to-right processing (the default behavior in JavaScript!) -- it has nothing to do with the associativity of `&&`. In that example, since there's only one `&&` and thus no relevant grouping here, associativity doesn't even come into play.

But with an expression like `a && b && c`, grouping *will* happen implicitly, meaning that either `a && b` or `b && c` will be evaluated first.

Technically, `a && b && c` will be handled as `(a && b) && c`, because `&&` is left-associative (so is `||`, by the way). However, the right-associative alternative `a && (b && c)` behaves observably the same way. For the same values, the same expressions are evaluated in the same order.

**Note:** If hypothetically `&&` was right-associative, it would be processed the same as if you manually used `( )` to create grouping like `a && (b && c)`. But that still **doesn't mean** that `c` would be processed before `b`. Right-associativity does **not** mean right-to-left evaluation, it means right-to-left **grouping**. Either way, regardless of the grouping/associativity, the strict ordering of evaluation will be `a`, then `b`, then `c` (aka left-to-right).

So it doesn't really matter that much that `&&` and `||` are left-associative, other than to be accurate in how we discuss their definitions.

But that's not always the case. Some operators would behave very differently depending on left-associativity vs. right-associativity.

Consider the `? :` ("ternary" or "conditional") operator:

```js
a ? b : c ? d : e;
```

`? :` is right-associative, so which grouping represents how it will be processed?

* `a ? b : (c ? d : e)`
* `(a ? b : c) ? d : e`

The answer is `a ? b : (c ? d : e)`. Unlike with `&&` and `||` above, the right-associativity here actually matters, as `(a ? b : c) ? d : e` *will* behave differently for some (but not all!) combinations of values.

One such example:

```js
true ? false : true ? true : true;		// false

true ? false : (true ? true : true);	// false
(true ? false : true) ? true : true;	// true
```

Even more nuanced differences lurk with other value combinations, even if the end result is the same. Consider:

```js
true ? false : true ? true : false;		// false

true ? false : (true ? true : false);	// false
(true ? false : true) ? true : false;	// false
```

From that scenario, the same end result implies that the grouping is moot. However:

```js
var a = true, b = false, c = true, d = true, e = false;

a ? b : (c ? d : e); // false, evaluates only `a` and `b`
(a ? b : c) ? d : e; // false, evaluates `a`, `b` AND `e`
```

So, we've clearly proved that `? :` is right-associative, and that it actually matters with respect to how the operator behaves if chained with itself.

Another example of right-associativity (grouping) is the `=` operator. Recall the chained assignment example from earlier in the chapter:

```js
var a, b, c;

a = b = c = 42;
```

We asserted earlier that `a = b = c = 42` is processed by first evaluating the `c = 42` assignment, then `b = ..`, and finally `a = ..`. Why? Because of the right-associativity, which actually treats the statement like this: `a = (b = (c = 42))`.

Remember our running complex assignment expression example from earlier in the chapter?

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";
var c = false;

var d = a && b || c ? c || b ? a : c && b : a;

d;		// 42
```

Armed with our knowledge of precedence and associativity, we should now be able to break down the code into its grouping behavior like this:

```js
((a && b) || c) ? ((c || b) ? a : (c && b)) : a
```

Or, to present it indented if that's easier to understand:

```js
(
  (a && b)
    ||
  c
)
  ?
(
  (c || b)
    ?
  a
    :
  (c && b)
)
  :
a
```

Let's solve it now:

1. `(a && b)` is `"foo"`.
2. `"foo" || c` is `"foo"`.
3. For the first `?` test, `"foo"` is truthy.
4. `(c || b)` is `"foo"`.
5. For the second `?` test, `"foo"` is truthy.
6. `a` is `42`.

That's it, we're done! The answer is `42`, just as we saw earlier. That actually wasn't so hard, was it?

### Disambiguation

You should now have a much better grasp on operator precedence (and associativity) and feel much more comfortable understanding how code with multiple chained operators will behave.

But an important question remains: should we all write code understanding and perfectly relying on all the rules of operator precedence/associativity? Should we only use `( )` manual grouping when it's necessary to force a different processing binding/order?

Or, on the other hand, should we recognize that even though such rules *are in fact* learnable, there's enough gotchas to warrant ignoring automatic precedence/associativity? If so, should we thus always use `( )` manual grouping and remove all reliance on these automatic behaviors?

This debate is highly subjective, and heavily symmetrical to the debate in Chapter 4 over *implicit* coercion. Most developers feel the same way about both debates: either they accept both behaviors and code expecting them, or they discard both behaviors and stick to manual/explicit idioms.

Of course, I cannot answer this question definitively for the reader here anymore than I could in Chapter 4. But I've presented you the pros and cons, and hopefully encouraged enough deeper understanding that you can make informed rather than hype-driven decisions.

In my opinion, there's an important middle ground. We should mix both operator precedence/associativity *and* `( )` manual grouping into our programs -- I argue the same way in Chapter 4 for healthy/safe usage of *implicit* coercion, but certainly don't endorse it exclusively without bounds.

For example, `if (a && b && c) ..` is perfectly OK to me, and I wouldn't do `if ((a && b) && c) ..` just to explicitly call out the associativity, because I think it's overly verbose.

On the other hand, if I needed to chain two `? :` conditional operators together, I'd certainly use `( )` manual grouping to make it absolutely clear what my intended logic is.

Thus, my advice here is similar to that of Chapter 4: **use operator precedence/associativity where it leads to shorter and cleaner code, but use `( )` manual grouping in places where it helps create clarity and reduce confusion.**

## Automatic Semicolons

ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion) is when JavaScript assumes a `;` in certain places in your JS program even if you didn't put one there.

Why would it do that? Because if you omit even a single required `;` your program would fail. Not very forgiving. ASI allows JS to be tolerant of certain places where `;` aren't commonly thought  to be necessary.

It's important to note that ASI will only take effect in the presence of a newline (aka line break). Semicolons are not inserted in the middle of a line.

Basically, if the JS parser parses a line where a parser error would occur (a missing expected `;`), and it can reasonably insert one, it does so. What's reasonable for insertion? Only if there's nothing but whitespace and/or comments between the end of some statement and that line's newline/line break.

Consider:

```js
var a = 42, b
c;
```

Should JS treat the `c` on the next line as part of the `var` statement? It certainly would if a `,` had come anywhere (even another line) between `b` and `c`. But since there isn't one, JS assumes instead that there's an implied `;` (at the newline) after `b`. Thus, `c;` is left as a standalone expression statement.

Similarly:

```js
var a = 42, b = "foo";

a
b	// "foo"
```

That's still a valid program without error, because expression statements also accept ASI.

There's certain places where ASI is helpful, like for instance:

```js
var a = 42;

do {
	// ..
} while (a)	// <-- ; expected here!
a;
```

The grammar requires a `;` after a `do..while` loop, but not after `while` or `for` loops. But most developers don't remember that! So, ASI helpfully steps in and inserts one.

As we said earlier in the chapter, statement blocks do not require `;` termination, so ASI isn't necessary:

```js
var a = 42;

while (a) {
	// ..
} // <-- no ; expected here
a;
```

The other major case where ASI kicks in is with the `break`, `continue`, `return`, and (ES6) `yield` keywords:

```js
function foo(a) {
	if (!a) return
	a *= 2;
	// ..
}
```

The `return` statement doesn't carry across the newline to the `a *= 2` expression, as ASI assumes the `;` terminating the `return` statement. Of course, `return` statements *can* easily break across multiple lines, just not when there's nothing after `return` but the newline/line break.

```js
function foo(a) {
	return (
		a * 2 + 3 / 12
	);
}
```

Identical reasoning applies to `break`, `continue`, and `yield`.

### Error Correction

One of the most hotly contested *religious wars* in the JS community (besides tabs vs. spaces) is whether to rely heavily/exclusively on ASI or not.

Most, but not all, semicolons are optional, but the two `;`s in the `for ( .. ) ..` loop header are required.

On the pro side of this debate, many developers believe that ASI is a useful mechanism that allows them to write more terse (and more "beautiful") code by omitting all but the strictly required `;`s (which are very few). It is often asserted that ASI makes many `;`s optional, so a correctly written program *without them* is no different than a correctly written program *with them*.

On the con side of the debate, many other developers will assert that there are *too many* places that can be accidental gotchas, especially for newer, less experienced developers, where unintended `;`s being magically inserted change the meaning. Similarly, some developers will argue that if they omit a semicolon, it's a flat-out mistake, and they want their tools (linters, etc.) to catch it before the JS engine *corrects* the mistake under the covers.

Let me just share my perspective. A strict reading of the spec implies that ASI is an "error correction" routine. What kind of error, you may ask? Specifically, a **parser error**. In other words, in an attempt to have the parser fail less, ASI lets it be more tolerant.

But tolerant of what? In my view, the only way a **parser error** occurs is if it's given an incorrect/errored program to parse. So, while ASI is strictly correcting parser errors, the only way it can get such errors is if there were first program authoring errors -- omitting semicolons where the grammar rules require them.

So, to put it more bluntly, when I hear someone claim that they want to omit "optional semicolons," my brain translates that claim to "I want to write the most parser-broken program I can that will still work."

I find that to be a ludicrous position to take and the arguments of saving keystrokes and having more "beautiful code" to be weak at best.

Furthermore, I don't agree that this is the same thing as the spaces vs tabs debate -- that it's purely cosmetic -- but rather I believe it's a fundamental question of writing code that adheres to grammar requirements vs. code that relies on grammar exceptions to just barely skate through.

Another way of looking at it is that relying on ASI is essentially considering newlines to be significant "whitespace." Other languages like Python have true significant whitespace. But is it really appropriate to think of JavaScript as having significant newlines as it stands today?

My take: **use semicolons wherever you know they are "required," and limit your assumptions about ASI to a minimum.**

But don't just take my word for it. Back in 2012, creator of JavaScript Brendan Eich said (http://brendaneich.com/2012/04/the-infernal-semicolon/) the following:

> The moral of this story: ASI is (formally speaking) a syntactic error correction procedure. If you start to code as if it were a universal significant-newline rule, you will get into trouble.
> ..
> I wish I had made newlines more significant in JS back in those ten days in May, 1995.
> ..
> Be careful not to use ASI as if it gave JS significant newlines.

## Errors

Not only does JavaScript have different *subtypes* of errors (`TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, etc.), but also the grammar defines certain errors to be enforced at compile time, as compared to all other errors that happen during runtime.

In particular, there have long been a number of specific conditions that should be caught and reported as "early errors" (during compilation). Any straight-up syntax error is an early error (e.g., `a = ,`), but also the grammar defines things that are syntactically valid but disallowed nonetheless.

Since execution of your code has not begun yet, these errors are not catchable with `try..catch`; they will just fail the parsing/compilation of your program.

**Tip:** There's no requirement in the spec about exactly how browsers (and developer tools) should report errors. So you may see variations across browsers in the following error examples, in what specific subtype of error is reported or what the included error message text will be.

One simple example is with syntax inside a regular expression literal. There's nothing wrong with the JS syntax here, but the invalid regex will throw an early error:

```js
var a = /+foo/;		// Error!
```

The target of an assignment must be an identifier (or an ES6 destructuring expression that produces one or more identifiers), so a value like `42` in that position is illegal and can be reported right away:

```js
var a;
42 = a;		// Error!
```

ES5's `strict` mode defines even more early errors. For example, in `strict` mode, function parameter names cannot be duplicated:

```js
function foo(a,b,a) { }					// just fine

function bar(a,b,a) { "use strict"; }	// Error!
```

Another `strict` mode early error is an object literal having more than one property of the same name:

```js
(function(){
	"use strict";

	var a = {
		b: 42,
		b: 43
	};			// Error!
})();
```

**Note:** Semantically speaking, such errors aren't technically *syntax* errors but more *grammar* errors -- the above snippets are syntactically valid. But since there is no `GrammarError` type, some browsers use `SyntaxError` instead.

### Using Variables Too Early

ES6 defines a (frankly confusingly named) new concept called the TDZ ("Temporal Dead Zone").

The TDZ refers to places in code where a variable reference cannot yet be made, because it hasn't reached its required initialization.

The most clear example of this is with ES6 `let` block-scoping:

```js
{
	a = 2;		// ReferenceError!
	let a;
}
```

The assignment `a = 2` is accessing the `a` variable (which is indeed block-scoped to the `{ .. }` block) before it's been initialized by the `let a` declaration, so it's in the TDZ for `a` and throws an error.

Interestingly, while `typeof` has an exception to be safe for undeclared variables (see Chapter 1), no such safety exception is made for TDZ references:

```js
{
	typeof a;	// undefined
	typeof b;	// ReferenceError! (TDZ)
	let b;
}
```

## Function Arguments

Another example of a TDZ violation can be seen with ES6 default parameter values (see the *ES6 & Beyond* title of this series):

```js
var b = 3;

function foo( a = 42, b = a + b + 5 ) {
	// ..
}
```

The `b` reference in the assignment would happen in the TDZ for the parameter `b` (not pull in the outer `b` reference), so it will throw an error. However, the `a` in the assignment is fine since by that time it's past the TDZ for parameter `a`.

When using ES6's default parameter values, the default value is applied to the parameter if you either omit an argument, or you pass an `undefined` value in its place:

```js
function foo( a = 42, b = a + 1 ) {
	console.log( a, b );
}

foo();					// 42 43
foo( undefined );		// 42 43
foo( 5 );				// 5 6
foo( void 0, 7 );		// 42 7
foo( null );			// null 1
```

**Note:** `null` is coerced to a `0` value in the `a + 1` expression. See Chapter 4 for more info.

From the ES6 default parameter values perspective, there's no difference between omitting an argument and passing an `undefined` value. However, there is a way to detect the difference in some cases:

```js
function foo( a = 42, b = a + 1 ) {
	console.log(
		arguments.length, a, b,
		arguments[0], arguments[1]
	);
}

foo();					// 0 42 43 undefined undefined
foo( 10 );				// 1 10 11 10 undefined
foo( 10, undefined );	// 2 10 11 10 undefined
foo( 10, null );		// 2 10 null 10 null
```

Even though the default parameter values are applied to the `a` and `b` parameters, if no arguments were passed in those slots, the `arguments` array will not have entries.

Conversely, if you pass an `undefined` argument explicitly, an entry will exist in the `arguments` array for that argument, but it will be `undefined` and not (necessarily) the same as the default value that was applied to the named parameter for that same slot.

While ES6 default parameter values can create divergence between the `arguments` array slot and the corresponding named parameter variable, this same disjointedness can also occur in tricky ways in ES5:

```js
function foo(a) {
	a = 42;
	console.log( arguments[0] );
}

foo( 2 );	// 42 (linked)
foo();		// undefined (not linked)
```

If you pass an argument, the `arguments` slot and the named parameter are linked to always have the same value. If you omit the argument, no such linkage occurs.

But in `strict` mode, the linkage doesn't exist regardless:

```js
function foo(a) {
	"use strict";
	a = 42;
	console.log( arguments[0] );
}

foo( 2 );	// 2 (not linked)
foo();		// undefined (not linked)
```

It's almost certainly a bad idea to ever rely on any such linkage, and in fact the linkage itself is a leaky abstraction that's exposing an underlying implementation detail of the engine, rather than a properly designed feature.

Use of the `arguments` array has been deprecated (especially in favor of ES6 `...` rest parameters -- see the *ES6 & Beyond* title of this series), but that doesn't mean that it's all bad.

Prior to ES6, `arguments` is the only way to get an array of all passed arguments to pass along to other functions, which turns out to be quite useful. You can also mix named parameters with the `arguments` array and be safe, as long as you follow one simple rule: **never refer to a named parameter *and* its corresponding `arguments` slot at the same time.** If you avoid that bad practice, you'll never expose the leaky linkage behavior.

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + arguments[1] ); // safe!
}

foo( 10, 32 );	// 42
```

## `try..finally`

You're probably familiar with how the `try..catch` block works. But have you ever stopped to consider the `finally` clause that can be paired with it? In fact, were you aware that `try` only requires either `catch` or `finally`, though both can be present if needed.

The code in the `finally` clause *always* runs (no matter what), and it always runs right after the `try` (and `catch` if present) finish, before any other code runs. In one sense, you can kind of think of the code in a `finally` clause as being in a callback function that will always be called regardless of how the rest of the block behaves.

So what happens if there's a `return` statement inside a `try` clause? It obviously will return a value, right? But does the calling code that receives that value run before or after the `finally`?

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( "Hello" );
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Hello
// 42
```

The `return 42` runs right away, which sets up the completion value from the `foo()` call. This action completes the `try` clause and the `finally` clause immediately runs next. Only then is the `foo()` function complete, so that its completion value is returned back for the `console.log(..)` statement to use.

The exact same behavior is true of a `throw` inside `try`:

```js
 function foo() {
	try {
		throw 42;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( "Hello" );
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Hello
// Uncaught Exception: 42
```

Now, if an exception is thrown (accidentally or intentionally) inside a `finally` clause, it will override as the primary completion of that function. If a previous `return` in the `try` block had set a completion value for the function, that value will be abandoned.

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		throw "Oops!";
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Uncaught Exception: Oops!
```

It shouldn't be surprising that other nonlinear control statements like `continue` and `break` exhibit similar behavior to `return` and `throw`:

```js
for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
	try {
		continue;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( i );
	}
}
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

The `console.log(i)` statement runs at the end of the loop iteration, which is caused by the `continue` statement. However, it still runs before the `i++` iteration update statement, which is why the values printed are `0..9` instead of `1..10`.

**Note:** ES6 adds a `yield` statement, in generators (see the *Async & Performance* title of this series) which in some ways can be seen as an intermediate `return` statement. However, unlike a `return`, a `yield` isn't complete until the generator is resumed, which means a `try { .. yield .. }` has not completed. So an attached `finally` clause will not run right after the `yield` like it does with `return`.

A `return` inside a `finally` has the special ability to override a previous `return` from the `try` or `catch` clause, but only if `return` is explicitly called:

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// no `return ..` here, so no override
	}
}

function bar() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// override previous `return 42`
		return;
	}
}

function baz() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// override previous `return 42`
		return "Hello";
	}
}

foo();	// 42
bar();	// undefined
baz();	// "Hello"
```

Normally, the omission of `return` in a function is the same as `return;` or even `return undefined;`, but inside a `finally` block the omission of `return` does not act like an overriding `return undefined`; it just lets the previous `return` stand.

In fact, we can really up the craziness if we combine `finally` with labeled `break` (discussed earlier in the chapter):

```js
function foo() {
	bar: {
		try {
			return 42;
		}
		finally {
			// break out of `bar` labeled block
			break bar;
		}
	}

	console.log( "Crazy" );

	return "Hello";
}

console.log( foo() );
// Crazy
// Hello
```

But... don't do this. Seriously. Using a `finally` + labeled `break` to effectively cancel a `return` is doing your best to create the most confusing code possible. I'd wager no amount of comments will redeem this code.

## `switch`

Let's briefly explore the `switch` statement, a sort-of syntactic shorthand for an `if..else if..else..` statement chain.

```js
switch (a) {
	case 2:
		// do something
		break;
	case 42:
		// do another thing
		break;
	default:
		// fallback to here
}
```

As you can see, it evaluates `a` once, then matches the resulting value to each `case` expression (just simple value expressions here). If a match is found, execution will begin in that matched `case`, and will either go until a `break` is encountered or until the end of the `switch` block is found.

That much may not surprise you, but there are several quirks about `switch` you may not have noticed before.

First, the matching that occurs between the `a` expression and each `case` expression is identical to the `===` algorithm (see Chapter 4). Often times `switch`es are used with absolute values in `case` statements, as shown above, so strict matching is appropriate.

However, you may wish to allow coercive equality (aka `==`, see Chapter 4), and to do so you'll need to sort of "hack" the `switch` statement a bit:

```js
var a = "42";

switch (true) {
	case a == 10:
		console.log( "10 or '10'" );
		break;
	case a == 42:
		console.log( "42 or '42'" );
		break;
	default:
		// never gets here
}
// 42 or '42'
```

This works because the `case` clause can have any expression (not just simple values), which means it will strictly match that expression's result to the test expression (`true`). Since `a == 42` results in `true` here, the match is made.

Despite `==`, the `switch` matching itself is still strict, between `true` and `true` here. If the `case` expression resulted in something that was truthy but not strictly `true` (see Chapter 4), it wouldn't work. This can bite you if you're for instance using a "logical operator" like `||` or `&&` in your expression:

```js
var a = "hello world";
var b = 10;

switch (true) {
	case (a || b == 10):
		// never gets here
		break;
	default:
		console.log( "Oops" );
}
// Oops
```

Since the result of `(a || b == 10)` is `"hello world"` and not `true`, the strict match fails. In this case, the fix is to force the expression explicitly to be a `true` or `false`, such as `case !!(a || b == 10):` (see Chapter 4).

Lastly, the `default` clause is optional, and it doesn't necessarily have to come at the end (although that's the strong convention). Even in the `default` clause, the same rules apply about encountering a `break` or not:

```js
var a = 10;

switch (a) {
	case 1:
	case 2:
		// never gets here
	default:
		console.log( "default" );
	case 3:
		console.log( "3" );
		break;
	case 4:
		console.log( "4" );
}
// default
// 3
```

**Note:** As discussed previously about labeled `break`s, the `break` inside a `case` clause can also be labeled.

The way this snippet processes is that it passes through all the `case` clause matching first, finds no match, then goes back up to the `default` clause and starts executing. Since there's no `break` there, it continues executing in the already skipped over `case 3` block, before stopping once it hits that `break`.

While this sort of round-about logic is clearly possible in JavaScript, there's almost no chance that it's going to make for reasonable or understandable code. Be very skeptical if you find yourself wanting to create such circular logic flow, and if you really do, make sure you include plenty of code comments to explain what you're up to!

## Review

JavaScript grammar has plenty of nuance that we as developers should spend a little more time paying closer attention to than we typically do. A little bit of effort goes a long way to solidifying your deeper knowledge of the language.

Statements and expressions have analogs in English language -- statements are like sentences and expressions are like phrases. Expressions can be pure/self-contained, or they can have side effects.

The JavaScript grammar layers semantic usage rules (aka context) on top of the pure syntax. For example, `{ }` pairs used in various places in your program can mean statement blocks, `object` literals, (ES6) destructuring assignments, or (ES6) named function arguments.

JavaScript operators all have well-defined rules for precedence (which ones bind first before others) and associativity (how multiple operator expressions are implicitly grouped). Once you learn these rules, it's up to you to decide if precedence/associativity are *too implicit* for their own good, or if they will aid in writing shorter, clearer code.

ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion) is a parser-error-correction mechanism built into the JS engine, which allows it under certain circumstances to insert an assumed `;` in places where it is required, was omitted, *and* where insertion fixes the parser error. The debate rages over whether this behavior implies that most `;` are optional (and can/should be omitted for cleaner code) or whether it means that omitting them is making mistakes that the JS engine merely cleans up for you.

JavaScript has several types of errors, but it's less known that it has two classifications for errors: "early" (compiler thrown, uncatchable) and "runtime" (`try..catch`able). All syntax errors are obviously early errors that stop the program before it runs, but there are others, too.

Function arguments have an interesting relationship to their formal declared named parameters. Specifically, the `arguments` array has a number of gotchas of leaky abstraction behavior if you're not careful. Avoid `arguments` if you can, but if you must use it, by all means avoid using the positional slot in `arguments` at the same time as using a named parameter for that same argument.

The `finally` clause attached to a `try` (or `try..catch`) offers some very interesting quirks in terms of execution processing order. Some of these quirks can be helpful, but it's possible to create lots of confusion, especially if combined with labeled blocks. As always, use `finally` to make code better and clearer, not more clever or confusing.

The `switch` offers some nice shorthand for `if..else if..` statements, but beware of many common simplifying assumptions about its behavior. There are several quirks that can trip you up if you're not careful, but there's also some neat hidden tricks that `switch` has up its sleeve!
